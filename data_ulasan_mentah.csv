Good application ✨;
A poor version of Twitter. Meta should just give up at this point, the company sucks the last 5 years.;
;
;
;
;
Wanna know about this app;
Good lounch app;
;
This app is 90% Copy Of Twitter, It's cheating...;
;
Great app;
;
Better than Twitter freedom of speech 💬😀;
Best app atleast for now it's yoo good 💯;
;
;
Nice app 👍🏻;
;
;
Twitter is better;
"Instagram in a different format .. how is this ""Twitter's"" competition?";
3rd class application boring;
;
I can' t signup new account, need to install instragram something.;
Finally this app realesed. It's more useful.;
"hate the algorithm, ain't no one likes my posts😒 plus the badge won't be removed from my Instagram acc tho I choose ""remove""";
Room for improvement;
The badge keeps coming back on IG profile, even after you select to hide it several times.;
;
I don't need separate/additional app just to share my ideas or minds, there's already Twitter;
Can't log in without Instagram account. Not interested, bye...;
same as teitter , so not interested in more social platforms forms offering nothing new. tcs;
I can't find Instagram bottom;
;
Firstly I want to say that this Platform is too much Useful and Advance with all the new features and I Love meta ❤️;
I think you should add a private message section;
it's amazing and it all free;
;
Threads is more better than twitter.😎😎;
Plz try to remove threads I'd from Instagram bio. I don't want to use threads application in my Instagram id so plz solve my problem bcz you are putting this forcefully to our Instagram id and after starting this app u can't delete your I'd so plz solve my problem everyone are not happy with this app. Thank you;
Until now I have not faced any problems regarding its usage and good thing is that it doesn't contain any type of ads on it.;
I wanted to use this social network, but unfortunately its algorithms are built to destroy freedom of speech and support the Russian invasion of Ukraine, accordingly one star.;
Copy paste of twitter.;
;
If you still have instagram gotta install this just to login using instagram only chat with private friends so don't see much use of any of it;
;
I can't post videos since 😏😏😏 failed failure;
Buggy mess;
Best Social media platform To Shareing Own Activity...!!;
;
;
;
;
This app is an amazing app, very interesting, but it doesn't have a future of direct message.;
its ok but such boring its good but somewhere is missing. overall its good;
don't sale our data meta;
;
Y'all need an update asap;
;
;
Until it becomes a dumpster fire like other platforms it's not bad. Bots are making their way into the platform, and I care not to see posts from accounts that I do not follow in my feed. Would like to see migrated over the translation feature at least;
"I think it's a decent start. Some features I think would be important going forward, though; the ability to search topics and tags rather than just people. To go along with this, the ability to follow specific topics would do much for the ability to curate a homepage. Also, having an in-app direct messaging system would do much to improve the experience. Other than that, and the fact that this app is still in its infancy, I can see a good potential for Threads as a platform.";
Can't install the app;
I can't open the App 😥😥;
It doesn't connect on my phone;
Very poor. My feed is full of rubbish, not from the people I follow. I can't even turn the dross off in the settings. No chance of replacing Twitter in this state 🥱;
Unusable app. The whole app starts glitching as soon as I scroll;
;
Im impressed this aap thanks for lunch this aap;
This is amazing appreciation;
DID I even install this app on my phone? Now I'm beginning to get very weary of META.;
;
;
They want me to pay for a service that show's no improvement;
When I try to write a post the app shuts down. It's done it 3 times in a row now. It's the latest version and fully updated.;
Lack of features...;
Awesome experience to work on this day I will manage it possible;
;
I won't to delete this app , but I can't;
Yeee I think this is good;
Cool but mine is having shredded display;
I'm not sure if it's ready to be a good app,it needs a lot more than it is, and my opinion is that it shouldn't be a part of Instagram but totally something else;
First and foremost, the user interface of Threads is beautifully designed and user-friendly. Navigating through the app is a breeze, with intuitive controls and a clean layout that makes it easy to find what you're looking for. The app's attention to detail in terms of aesthetics is commendable, and it truly enhances the overall user experience;
It's important for youth;
Yet another social media app. Bridging Instagram and Facebook to compete with Twitter. Not great, not horrible...just another scroll trap. For some reason there's no way to see stuff you've previously liked.;
;
Pointless app. Resource hog/battery killer.;
Use of threads after one day, Shuru mazboori me kiye the ab mza aa rha hai 🔥;
Steals way too much data it doesn't need and is just a breeding ground for unhinged liberals to brainwash kids;
;
Stuck on login screen;
Nice App;
Best app;
Very simple app.;
;
Need the option for switching into other accounts like Instagram, it's quite a hassle, after being addicted to easy switch method in Instagram;
"The logo of the app reminds me of the cover of the novel ""Play it as it lays"" by Joan Didion 🙂";
Twitter copy paste;
Scam;
I fell it... And it is best compare to twiter.. Bye bye twiter😅😅;
I don't have Instagram.. but I want to have Threads... this is not possible. I can't log in.;
;
This app became place for sexual and onlyfans promotion within 5 days;
;
Cool but idk if this is relating to my issuse but ever since i got this my insta acct that's linked to it keeps crashing??? Themes wont work??;
Nice of this app guy's😍😍😍✌✌✌;
I love threads. It's kind of like Twitter but it's a bit different.;
;
The app's concept is great👍👍;
;
fix the bugs issue i dont use it properly;
;
This is a new app I hope it will be good;
;
Copy of Twitter;
Beautiful apps... .;
Easy to use;
Hey I'm not able to post anything with pictures....Do something about it;
;
its so good to use such an app which is better than twitter. please when are you guys releasing the pc version. we cant wait for that one too.;
;
Here's my honest review: It's not a bad app, but there could be more features alike that could make the whole app more fun to use. Much like how Instagram allows you to switch accounts, maybe Threads could use the same feature. The only method to switching is by logging out currently. What I liked the most was the dark theme that it came with upon opening the app. Easy to get used to.;
;
;
This app is perfect for understanding your point of view;
This app is garbage, collects highly personal data that is unnecessary. Tried this out it sucks deleting it now.;
;
;
Why does it want my personal data? So they can sell it to businesses and profit off my personal information? No thanks. Uninstall;
App is clearly not ready for release. Integration with Instagram is great, however the biggest letdown is having the home feed being filled with randos, with no way to make it *only people I follow*. I'm patiently waiting for this issue to improve. Otherwise good concept, UI is great, user experience is okay;
To use this app they need to collect every single bit of your data. They know if you believe in God or not, they know who your friends are, your family, where you are at any time, they know what websites you browse. They know literally EVERYTHING about you. And the most terrifying stuff in all that, is that you ACCEPT it. They tell you that they collect everything about you (to sell it) and you accept it. Wake up. WAKE UP !!!!!!;
;
;
;
Constant crashing when trying to upload most photos, although there doesn't seem to be a pattern of image size or resolution, which causes it to crash or simply fail to upload. I have, however, been able to upload images up to 44MP, 33MB successfully uploaded. Would like the option to clear the random rubbish from my feed without having to keep muting them!;
I think this is best app for Twitter;
It's an app that violates every thing about privacy worst idea ever from Instagram;
;
Need to improve media support. You cannot copy paste images/gif via clipboard. Every time need to import it from attachments icon. Voice for videos is not working as well.;
;
;
So this this Zuckerberg's tuntrum trying to copy Musk just like he copied myspace. Why can't he be original?...;
Just a dumber version of twitter. Can't be even called twitter lite. And just like all Facebook apps, it's censorship pron and also say goodbye to your privacy.;
;
too buggy.. the screen just overlaps with its previous state and the whole screen goes bad;
Excellent app my first experience on that,so it is exceptional it great then twitter;
Broken application. Sometimes some message disappeare. App has been removed;
Yall experiencing pages and posts overlapping each other... Go to profile, theres button at the top right corner then report a problem.. just go there then go back to homepage and the bug's gone☺️;
Fantastic app thanks Mark jukerberg;
Huge network problem;
I am unable to login or sign up.. Because I don't like instagram so I don't have account on it that's why on threads I can't even sign up that's totally wrong when you launching a new app you should have atleast that much sence to take non Instagram users on ur platform or allow them to use it;
Threads need some translation cause being an international kpop fan is so hard when there's no translations;
Threads doesn't work properly on Vivo device screen is spread and got stuck please fix this issue...and plzz make it Android 9 version;
Its really cool specially in the first version, it also be cool that when we scroll up, see the app icon to tap it and get a better reflesh action;
Excellent alternative;
I just know that for threads to work properly it will take a couple of years. Cause it took twitter a long time. And also if you delete the app it deletes your instagram account;
;
I just installed and then uninstalled, totally wasted, if you don't have any Instagram account, you can't to login in threads, and we all know that Instagram is a su*ks.;
Much better than Twitter, and currently no Elon fan boys;
;
;
Good stuff;
Instagram team please don't under review my video;
Bad app;
Great alternative to apps like Twitter. I actually enjoy it way more.. somehow different;
The greatest ever and more than that bird icon with blue colour 🤟😎🤣;
More than a twitter;
It's glitching every time I open it;
Good app NYC experience;
It takes a lot time while installing... Reach of the posts is not so good...;
Super op appp;
This app is very lacking I can't even swipe anything;
Copycat! do I need say more??;
Bugs;
;
Because deleting the insta id;
Copycat app like Twitter. Unethical!;
no dark mode?;
;
The application was not working well.when I was it's showing nothing just scraching.not proper working.very bad experience.better to use Instagram...;
It doesn't run ... Get crashed everytime i try to use it;
;
While trying to upload photo the app is crashing;
;
Amezing this app but chat option available in threads app;
Its wonderful app ❤️✅;
Has nothing new;
A great app given the fact it's only been a few days since it launched but there are obviously some flaws into it. For example, when I want to post a picture, it often kicks me out of the app and takes hours for it to allow me to post that picture. I also usually can't see who just started following me, shows me my followers fine at first but once I surpass 50-ish followers, I stop receiving notifications and I can no longer see the usernames of those who follow me.;
To much loading im still waiting very bad app;
I downloaded the app it was all fine... I connected it to my insta account but as soon as I started scrolling it got hanged and smt weird was happening like the app was having some bug... Plzz fix it..;
please add translation option😭🙏🏻;
Too good liked the AI and UI of the app 💯 Instagram connection is a great way to enhance the use of both apps. Great reach with least marketing. Happy threading.;
;
I wanna like the app, but it keeps crashing every time I try to post a photo;
;
;
I like it;
Worst experience as it is not opening even atleast for 2 times i have uninstalled it still not working and now i have uninstalled it;
Very nice app, but its missing a few things such as switching accounts, hashtags, taking pictures, etc Its very smooth and well optimized, unlike instagram for Android which is ironic;
Nice & Good;
It's gud;
Faul app, not closed to Twitter;
If I don't have / want an Instagram account so I can't login, that's not acceptable. I am uninstalling the app.;
We need an organized feed that doesn't lose position everytime we move from it. Have it at least load a certain number of threads that will be shown next when we drag down to refresh the feed and so on. Such a basic feature;
Good;
As usual, Mark is stealing other people's ideas, one star for this one, for sure;
*Twitter* killed.;
Worst aap when I'm opening this app it's getting close 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬;
lemme explain what scam this is, It will not deactivate even if you deactivate. also, when u want to delete that stupid badge on instagram page, it will appear tone after time after timeeeeee!!!!;
We shall see.....I hope this stays unlike twitter;
;
This app could use a free mode, like FB you know;
It's been glitching ever since I've downloaded it;
If I wanted to be on a subpar app where disinfo was not being flagged and allowed to run rampant, I'd just stay on twitter.;
This app is far better than Twitter ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ** Writing this down so that mfs from insta don't join twitter **;
The App crashes again and again, think the developer for to give it the testing team, and push it to live. I'll download the next public release.;
Very bad;
;
It is the wich can break down twitter;
Zuck a copier Useless app;
;
It actually have a lot of bugs! Thread team should fix the bug first before it launched!;
I can't find follow requests sent to me in the ❤ section. It was there but than disappeared? I am very disappointed with it;
Crashes when uploading pics;
I had Awesome Experience using, User Interface is simple, No Fake Accounts, Bots Trolls etc.. like on Twitter hope this app will Replace Twitter and Be A Better Alternative.;
I think it's a really nice app 👍🏾🙃;
I think it's linked with a an app called *'Sure Fixed Matches'*;
Please give me myy account backkk;
Unable to upload 4 picture;
Good app;
;
I wish there is a chat option in threads too, so that we are able to share threads with one another on the same platform instead of copying the link and sharing it on instagram. Also, it would be better if we are able to download the video or the picture directly. I personally feel that maybe threads should be a part of instagram instead of being a complete seperate app.. Just like how reels are a part, threads should also be a part of instagram. That would be nice and easier.;
Not bad so far;
"App bans your accounts (Instagram too) for truth about Ukraine. Another app for making money on ""pink"" news and products. Avoid it.";
So far so good.;
;
;
Not username change;
;
It's just a clone of Twitter;
The app was using about 99% of my battery. Deleted it and my battery was working normal.;
Meh, I'm on the fence about it. I know it's new but it has a bunch of things that needs fixing. The timeline, if that's what it's called, needs to show stuff from who I follow, not everyone. I'll check the replies for those comments. Need a dark mode option and ability to make fonts BIGGER and maybe a bold option as well. Also a definite need is when you open the app or refresh the thread, don't go all the way to the top. Keep the thread where I left off, thanks.;
useless, can't even change name or username other than Instagram.;
;
Great app really but highly addictive (send help);
;
Requires stupid amount of permissions, can't delete account, and looks awful. It's a very disorganized mess.;
This app is recommendable for fast com.;
Try to add bookmark feature like Twitter;
AWFUL, TWITTER BETTER;
This app is a privacy nightmare, collects all of your data and worst of all it's owned by Facebook;
Ducking app;
It's definitely cool;
Great app;
Is very realy;
For an app that just launched a few days ago, it's honestly pretty good!! However, there are a few things I'd like to see improved & made: hashtags, folder to save threads, draft notes.;
;
;
Nice competitor of Twitter;
Needs more features;
Twitter was so much better than it .;
Hi dev team I downloaded this app, and I have been trying to login with ig as requested but it always fails saying there's a problem trying to be fixed. What's the problem?;
We can't text in the app;
Collects way to much data;
Carry on;
Ok, first of all, many things are missing in this app. We need a poll option, we need to be properly able to share links, and a lot more gimmicky stuff is missing. Please add them ASAP;
Always keeps crashing when iam trying to upload something;
Copy of twitter;
Very trash app twitter is 1000X better get free speech then we can talk;
Mind-blowing;
So far so good;
Please work on the sounds, there are no sounds for notification on Threads Also, we can't message privately;
A very good App;
While it's still adding features, sure, it's not MuskTwitter and it's pretty close to the old twitter, so enjoy!;
;
Best;
Not bad;
Me aparece buggeado el texto, todo se mira borroso;
For a just starting app, it's suprisingly good. Like astonishingly so.;
Such a cozy platform visually, in my opinion. Just cannot scroll through my notifications.... can yall fix it that?;
Something is wrong with this app, cause it's not working on my phone at all. It's just cloning pages like hundreds and thousands;
;
;
;
Is this threads app safe or not Social media talking about thread pls uninstall the app if don't uninstall u r instagram was deleted 🥲;
Threads vs Twitter 😂🤣;
Not as good as Twitter it's similar to Instagram;
Ugh, Mr. Zuck collects too much personal data with this app. Let alone all the political bias on his platforms. Stay away!;
As a developer and a normal user, the app is really easy to navigate through and also has a simple ui.;
;
Copy of twitter .;
;
Nice.;
Very Bad and Boring 😂;
App is not working properly it is stuck in The middle;
Unnecessary.;
Nothing is interesting in the app. I was expecting something new.;
add a separate feed just for subscriptions and let us choose a general feed by interests or hashtags. i mean, the adds are fine, but not the whole messy feed.;
First of all I like this app. But this app is not working properly on my device maybe it's because of my old device. It's glitching, overlapping subrato pages in one page, etc. Other than that it's an amazing app.;
Just a cheap copy of Twitter, man they even copied the blue check.;
Threads is such a fun app but yes it can do with a few improvement but for myself it's perfect the way it is. It's definitely a goodbye to Twitter from me 😁;
i think THIS i's better for Twitter every body yous it this amazing apps;
Does not work!;
I wanna give them a 5star but they've gotta make an option where we can make dm, like everything is literally public 🥰🥰🥰 WITH ALL SAID, I'M ALREADY ADDICTED HAHA;
My followers stop increasing at a point why;
A torrent of meaningless celebrity spam and random posts from people I've never met.;
Needs a lot of work in my opinion. Not getting notifications when those I follow post, all notifications are on, still nothing. Would love it if those I do follow are 1st on my feed. Also, a translate option would be great as I follow non English speaking celebs and have to screenshot posts for translation.;
garbage ui, cant post images due to errors.... more r&d needed if you wanna rip off twitter successfully...;
I keep getting errors when trying to post images.;
Honestly, I haven't had many issues. I do want to see more functionality on this app. When I hit play on videos the sound doesn't play.;
Very bad UI.;
smells good and not musky like Twitter;
My insta keeps crashing ever since i joined threads;
Lots of bug;
I literally just installed this app and it won't even let me open it. It says the app is updating right now to try again later. How is the app updating if I literally just downloaded it?;
Multiple accounts needs to be included. Some of us have multiple Instagram accounts.;
;
Awesome;
;
Not much;
You can't delete your account without also deleting your Instagram account. Don't sign up, it's not worth it.;
It's the worst parts of Twitter combined with the worsts parts of Facebook;
Needs more features. You can't search posts. You can't use Hashtags. If you have a lot of Instagram followers, then chances are you'll have threads followers. Otherwise, there's no other way to get followers on here. I hope that you develop this app furthermore.;
Nice app ❤️❤️❤️;
i can't even download the app, keep taking my data, downloads still 100 but never installs so terrible;
It is not all the Hype the Media claims it is;
Best🔥⚡;
Better than Twitter already;
Love this app;
;
It would be great if you can add the feature foe logging in multiple accounts at the same time. Just like insta;
Useless pale copy of Twitter without soul and no fun and tremendous use of data. Pointless.;
cheater! Why can't we delete this account without deleting our Instagram, trash company,;
Love it;
there's a glitch in the app;
As same as Twitter 😂😂;
Best App;
Fix the algorithm first. I don't want to see those verified accounts on my timeline;
worst social network ever;
;
;
I don't use IG, pero gusto ko sana to i try kaso hindi makaka sign in unless may IG account.;
ASL enduku swamy e app em use undhi ? ( No use for this app 😤);
This is the most amazing app in the world. I saw it on Facebook today;
Not good, it requires an Instagram account, totally unsafe, your public opinion linked to you cellphone number, your personal information made public.;
I think it is great but some features needs to be advanced. First the photo loading time is still slow, secondly I suggest that all Meta Apps could be synced inform of tab/browser where you can switch platforms easly. For example if you are in threads you can have switcheable icons or tabs to navigate to Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and vice versa. Fourthly, there should be filters through which people could determine thematic areas of interest including themes, topics, personalities, etc;
A twitter alternative for intolerant leftists who can't cope with conservative opinions and want them censored.;
Twitter is better than threads 🤐;
✨It's just a copy of Twitter;
We need features here.... Thread Groups or Pages Maybe direct messages Hashtags Translations Reactions (like, haha, love, care, angry, wow, etc);
it is the future since elonnn destroyed twitt er;
;
I can't delete my account, they have tricked the users. And I can't even remove the badge from my Instagram account. It's like they are forcing to use this application. Losers, come up with your own ideas, stop stealing and copy pasting stuffs.;
Please don't put the letter's counting this is not good I wanna talk too much and express my feelings freely please solve this and let us be free in what we want to say ..;
Trash not threads. Twitter was long dead, musk just killed it. FB is long dead, now thief is simply trying to copy and squeeze some green out of dum peeps. People want to get their name, so they flocked there...will they use it? Nah...because it's just trash.;
Don't have an Instagram account and was no prompt to just make an account for this app. Maybe they'll figure it out later but currently useless app for me;
Great app twitter rival and a good one I used it on the first day of its release liked it. Mr musk is making twitter limited and pay for blue tick is very bad. Money can't buy everything. Hope this app will stay and more and more people come on this and this app should not follow the steps of musk and FB ads factory and keep our data save. Good luck treads.;
company policy is the same. you can't call a spade a spade, upload photo evidence of war crimes, because it doesn't make money, you can't sell advertising.;
5 rating for memes😂😂;
Please make it to show us post who we follow it not every post Here is a lot of post from everyone to we don't want to see Thanks 😊;
Was exited to try because, screw elon, but I'm not handing over all my data. Sorry can't do it.;
A wonderful and new application, but it is similar to Twitter, the only difference is that it is owned by Meta;
Better;
We need gif, a lot of funny gifts.;
wasted many hours downloading this app yesterday. Once I went near Instagram my Threads information was not locatable;
Zuck is a cuck xD Copy and paste garbage not even worth 1 minute of your time;
Copy, paste! And how can I permanently delet my account?;
App crashes upon trying to post content just another poorly executed copycat from zuck himself;
If you don't have an Instagram account already, you cannot even login to this app! There is no option to create an account here. Uninstalled.;
Worthless app for now. Created out of spite for another website, you know the one. Will update if it ever gets better.;
Can't post. Whenever I try to make a post the app crashes;
Twitter is your official Father;
The app is still new and I have installed the app for the first time. The setup was easy to do. One thing that I would love to see on the app is that you can upload videos on Threads and the other thing is that you can delete your profile and data because I have read that the only way to delete the data is to delete your Instagram account which I don't like because it's going to upset people when they want to delete their threads data.;
The app is good;
Trashapp. Had to sign up twice and still getting banned or under review after i have written the code on a paper received through my email and phone and also took a selfie. Like damn what else is there for a new user to verify lmao. Meta is a sensitive weakarse company who will never be better than twitter. Update: threads finally let me sign up and verification completed. I hope they don't piss others off but I give them 4 stars. Minus 1 star for pissing me off in the beginning.;
Doesn't refresh 😕 stays on the same thing 😂;
Get that option to look at your own Likes;
Worst app total copy paste;
Good 😊 Twitter vs thread Thread wan;
Very boring a bad and poor copy of Twitter.;
;
Apparently an Instagram account is needed, so not for me;
My Vote For Twitter. 😉 Sorry @Zuck;
To much data collection, sensorship, and ownership of images. Zuckerberg don't need anymore apps. His companies phony fact checks to control the narrative is unreal and the extreme censorship of speech. I'll stick with twitter thanks.;
Doesn't work with me I wanted to try it but it doesn't work for me;
I get the idea of competitive marketing, but making it this aggressive and making me have to delete my linked instagram to threads. U get one star;
The app was okay for the first couple of days and then all my verified accounts and political nonsense. Not even two days and it's turned into Twitter pre 2022.;
Need to be able to only see people I follow in my feed, there's too many accounts I don't care to see.;
아~ THREADS app을 이렇게요 ㅎㅎ 좀 재밌었어요 ㅇㅋ ok ok 하지만... 여기에서 전 끝 ㅎㅎ · (진짜...) 갈게요 :') ㅎㅎ ...흠 (twt Twt twt ••eh x') · @/threadsapp , @/zuck , @/mosseri , @/jackie.berardo , all THREADS's Team & everyone... 정말 감사합니다 🙇🏻‍♀️ 고생 많으셨고 정말 수고 많으셨습니다 ~^^ ♡화이팅 하세요~ :'D · 안녕히 계세요 ~ ^·^)/ 항상 건강하세요 ㅎㅎ (죄송합니다 🙇🏻‍♀️) · · 빠빠이~~~ 안녕 ... (comeback for some time, maybe(?) x'D ••eh ㅋㅋ);
The app is nice but please we need a poll feature.a pin to profile feature and a direct message feature that's all.;
This would be a great feat in three years to come ✔️✔️;
;
Threads seems to be the reason why my Instagram has stopped working. As for threads itself, I can't see the replies I'm getting. As soon as I have IG back I'm uninstall the whole lot. The functionality is just terrible.;
Wao nice app;
A horrible clone of Twitter abundunt with censorship and data collection.;
Crashes the Instagram app;
Try to add download feature;
Too many privacy concerns;
Sorry but I love elon musk;
Nice app;
I like it. But it needs improvements: 1. Please add the Options to choose pics from another folder. Its so hard to find it just to scroll down all the way. 2. Add the login option for IG lite user like me. This app is good right now especially I can post longer messages, (of course it's name is thread hehe). Good job Meta 👍🏻;
You can't use keywords to search for topics,big negative for me but I am looking forward to seeing the development process;
A fair warning: using this app gives facebook the right to all your data, and you can't delete the account without deleting your instagram account. Aside from that issue, there is so much basic functionality missing. How did Facebook (Meta) ever greenlight this app?;
I will happily download anything that could help Musk fail. 🤷🏼;
My app is not running clearly;
It's a great app however I can't open my Instagram now 😭 why?;
Better than Twitter;
New social media outlet;
Weird and cool luv it;
I'm loving the App Why you can't save pics on the App like Twitter or post any nudes on the App We need these issues fix;
;
;
Tis good;
Good apps and easy use;
The app threat people like a product and not a person. Taking your every detail including your personal health information... No wonder it can't show it's face in the EU. 🤦🏾;
This app don't work well at all on my phone;
Needs more functionality to compete with other social platforms like direct messaging and searching for anything other than accounts. Currently, the app is down for many people and there is no logic to why it went down. That is surprising and disappointing for such a big corporation already rooted in social media like Meta.;
Just installed, won't open;
I want to post a pic but it auto exits.;
I have a problem with the app;
It is an imitation of the Twitter program, why do I need this program when I have Twitter, it is stolen and the rights are taken;
Best app;
Extremely bad app. Has been screen lag from last 3 days and tried many time to fix it by redownloading the app but still doesn't work. Extremely worst expreience.;
Why does this app need so many permissions? I permanently deleted Facebook from my phone because somebody told me that I was online, but i did not open the app that day. Why would this app need biometrics and reroute phone calls and reorder running apps and see your health fitness and what other apps you have and activities you're doing and all of that?? Never going to use a meta app again;
I really love this... At least there's another room for opportunity... Twitter ads are cost . And getting engagement could be difficult.... But welcome THREAD....;
App crashes everytime I attach photo.;
Getting crashed for no reason..;
Buggy login experience but now I'm in. Much better platform than Twitter or Reddit at this point.;
Another app to waste time and sanity on 🥸;
BEST APPS I HAVE SEEN EVER.;
Like other meta garbage;
Please Instagram calm down don't disable my account again please 🙏🙏🙌🙏🙌🙏♥️🥺;
You're completely locked in if you sign up. No deleting your account unless you wanna lose your instagram too. Not to mention you fyp is covered in posts by people you don't even follow;
;
It's not working;
It cool;
I would learn, like, love from my thread.;
I want to express my appreciation for threads✨;
This a good app for chat;
Isse ek baar I'd banane pe isse delete account krne pe aapka insta account bhi delete ho jayega It's so very bad 😞 app 🤣🤣;
Bad app;
;
Needs instagram's explore page, DMs, and more features;
Amazing app loved it would have given it 6 star's if it was possible;
Trash. It's a tracking app. Do not download;
Very good app;
Great app with a lot of potential! However, there is a lot that needs to be fixed. For example, the option to mute accounts is lagging/delayed. This feature is definitely needed at this stage, which is part of the next problem. Another issue I've noticed is the home page shows a lot of accounts I don't follow and have never heard of, and a lot of blue check accounts that I don't want to see. There is no way to filter them out to see the content I actually want, from people I follow.;
;
I'm getting notifications from 2 days ago, not most recent. I would like to be able to sort my feed to only people I follow.;
Exellent app;
;
Zuckerberg gives the same one word responses Musk gives;
It's provides a good experience to build something meaningful.;
Visual bug can't even use to scroll list;
;
This app seems pretty good so far, but I have noticed that any post notifications have been a day late in being delivered!;
;
;
;
Not useful;
Most welcome new app;
Glitch in the Matrix!;
Its pretty decent, however I'm having problems with my notifications. I get the notifications VERY late, sometimes DAYS later.;
Nice app;
terrible app. Can't create a new account.;
That is twitter lite version;
;
;
I hate threads im from people twitter im son elon musk;
Best APK 🤞;
Making my personal instagram account crased;
Brand new;
Great start. Now keep updating it please.;
"Looks stable on Android so far. Please add an option to disable ""Autoplay"" function for videos.";
Terrible experience. Just use mastodon directly.;
;
;
Trashy basic ui it looks like they shipped it early just to take advantage of twitter being down;
One problem is facing no one liking the post;
"Threads ban accs that does not support Russian war... That's not ""off politics"" as it should be.";
UI is not coming properly. It's blurry can't read anything. So, please help me to fix it asap;
;
;
This app is not enough. I didn't like it. Because if we log in this app we will be stuck. If you log out from this, you will be logged out from Instagram. You should find a solution for this as soon as possible.;
Not happy at all. Do we really need to deactivate our Instagram profile to get rid of the Thread profile? Disappointed.;
Pretty much excellent start but I wish there was a minor option to just view the threads from users I'm following instead of everybody. Also there is no current way to search for a particular threads.;
More useful like Twitter 😜 but ise usse adhik le Jaya ja sakta hai . Jai hind 🇮🇳 sabhi ko🙏🏽🙏🏽❣️;
The Size Should Be little compressed ... And I Highly Recommend Makers To Make the feature which if any user want to delete his threads account then he/she Threads account only deletes , Not The Instagram account 🥺 As Insta is a emotion whereas threads is just launch....;
Just another platform for right-wing nutjobs.;
"Cannot save pictures & crashes posting pics! Twitter allows you to save any picture; Threads blocks downloads. On Twitter, I can easily post a picture; Threads crashes if I try to post a picture. Ridiculous! So far, this has been a pretty miserable app! I hope they fix it soon.";
Their ii so glitch;
I just wish this app had translation capabilities. 😪 I follow some very successful and super nice people from Japan and South Korea. I'm trying to learn how to read both languages, but translation capabilities would make it a little easier.;
The app invades users' privacy by abusing the public's lack of attention. I would like to delete my threads account but for that I need to delete the Instagram account, forcing users to continue using that app. This is completely ridiculous, you could have done better.;
;
Such a amazing app, nice algorithm;
This app so amazing and have full fill all the requirements;
;
My Instagram account was hacked after login into threads;
I want to remove my threads acc but not my instagram;
Could use a change of theme;
;
App is glitch, everything is mashed up together. Unusable;
;
Its an amazing app;
Not working properly;
I can't upload photos or videos. Every time I write a caption, the application immediately exits suddenly, why?;
;
Good social app;
;
;
It's trash.;
Very nice app 👍👍;
Worth it alone to see Elmo seethe and rage alongside the right-wingnuts.;
Not promising at all;
Just an FYI, a lot of these bad rating are from Twitter, and they don't like how it's not up to their expectations cause they are used to how Twitter is. Definitely not the app for them. Threads is new and more for the audience that is on tiktok kind of way. So, of course, they are gonna say the people posting on there sound stupid we are young and posting for our audience that find things funny and entertaining in our interest.;
it is a good option to opt twitter;
Cannot uninstall it deactivate my id when I delete it. Worst privacy;
;
How user friendly it is😍💯;
Good aap;
Everyone should just see the data collected by this app.;
;
Worst APP😒.;
;
Here it is also 10 million;
cant post gifs they come out purple and green and distorted and am not the only one that is happening to fix the app;
;
THANKS TO SO MUCH I LIKE APPLICATION;
i hope there are threads lite too🤧;
Unable to upload an image.;
Is good;
Very useful app 👍 thanks insta for gifting this type of app♥️♥️;
Its a trap 😆😆😂;
Much better than Twitter;
It is a very good app but there is a small problem, if we delete it when we don't need it, our Instagram account will also be deleted. Other than that, it's a better app than Twitter;
"It's moderated Twitter as opposed to 4chan esque current Twitter that is nearly impossible to check in public because it's become overrun by hate and bots for a particular blue and white website. DMs coming soon. Users concerned about privacy; if the app is free, you are the product. There isn't anything on this app that is going to know any more about you than the little tracking/gps/algorithm driven device you carry in your pocket everyday already knows.";
;
I feel really old, but I remember this app from back in the day called Twitter—it feels incredible, how far we have come as a species.;
Always very nice;
Problem1 : WHERE IS THE FOLLOWING TAB?? Problem2 : when I type in a text, and it lengthens , the text doesn't scroll up. Instead it gets covered underneath the on screen keyboard I'm typing on making it impossible for me to view the text while I'm typing it. Desired features : those 5 reaction from Facebook next to the standard Heart Like. And the no. Of views on a threads like Twitter has.;
Threads are better than twitter;
;
So far, so good. Simple and easy to use!;
This is great I recomend it to everybody;
Cant upload an image says failed to upload thread if i try to add an image;
;
Better this application ❤️;
I'll continue using instagram and WhatsApp cause they're good but Threads is not fun to use, rather use twitter;
;
App has way too many phone permissions. No way to turn off or delete without removing Instagram.;
I can't even use it properly. When I started to scroll or at least go to the other tabs it started to glitch and overlaps everything. Please fix this bug in the next update, I can't have the same experience like what my other friends does.;
;
There are a lot of glitches.. Whenever I'm trying to touch the screen it’s being overlapped..;
;
;
;
Not useful ,just a copy of another app👎👎;
Nice aap to threads an instagram aap very nice;
Bestest app 💜;
It is lagging and glitching too much ... I am not able to use it.. So frustrating;
Twitter flok;
I don't have Instagram ac.;
The application don't work properly... The interface is weird the letters are overlapping each other;
yeh app bhout bekar hai yeh app download karna se apka instagram connect ho jaye ga aur yeh app dellet karna se instagarm restart ho jaye ga yeh app install mat karo😠😠😠😠;
Good app...;
;
My account delete;
Great app;
Better than twitter ❤🥳;
text selection is bothering UX facebook's component was much better please consider using that one;
the app crashes when i try to upload photos. it's so annoying.;
Glitches;
Clone copy of Twitter.;
;
This app may share location and 12 more informations to third party apps. It is similar to fb and insta! Where is privacy after sharing my information to third party apps 😔 Disgusting;
Didn't know Reddit and Twitter had a child 🤷;
;
;
A refreshing social network that I truly need! Hopefully, the positivity and good vibes from this app will continue throughout the journey.. Better than than Twitter toxic community app! Definitely must try.;
Good project;
My threads app is glitched. It is not working at all. I hope Instagram team will fix this problem soon.;
Great app!;
very good app 👌🏻;
I have glitch in this app firstly I enetered all was working but after my second enterance the app hot glitched in which there were 2 oberlays in that solve this problem plz;
;
The error that is thrown in the UI is super annoying. The exact same thing happens to me every day. I didn't think this error would happen that often. Fix that problem.;
Can't delete threads account without deleting Instagram! Why does it need so many permissions that don't seem at all necessary? It's literally a copy of Twitter but with more censorship, tracking, and creepy personalized ads.;
This app is good.;
Slow work;
;
;
Worst app don't install this app because if you delete this app then your Instagram id will also delete;
Best app of our generation I love it;
;
;
;
It has a lot of bug... I can't even open the application;
It has a lot bug. Not working properly;
Very good App;
Horrible;
;
The aap is although very good.... But the refreshment takes a long time... And overall experience is good enough.;
So bad app;
The data collection is insane. Why would a twitter wannabe want my financial info, or my health info? Jesus, tone it down a bit, zuck.;
Not bad. It should allow you to save images and stuff. If this is gonna be a Twitter killer then be a Twitter killer.;
Nice app thrads vs twitter;
Dm options needed;
Change the app name with Threads aka Memes Central;
What is wrong 😭😭 not working only crashed 😭😭;
This app feels like if Facebook tried to make a Twitter app. It keeps crashing. Had to uninstall, now trying to reinstall;
Dekhta hu isme blue tick milta hai ya nahi;
I enjoy the app and viewing what is on it, but I can't even post on it. Every time I even attempt to post something it glitches out. So I'm just bummed about that :/;
Not download;
Stick with the OG. Twitter is far superior;
Crashes every time I try posting a simple photo. Happens with both Samsung Galaxy S21 and S23. Would love to see a way to toggle between random posts and those from only people I follow.;
this is not only bland but full of cringe Facebook users who thinks this is still 2012;
;
Starting was good like login and editing the bio. But after that when I opened the app to see what type of features and contents it contain. It started glitching and always it acts weird. Didn't expected this type of bad work from Meta. The application needs a lot of development. Looks like it's a launch without trial. Very disappoint. Want to delete my Threads a/c but for that Instagram a/c also will be deleted because thats the algo. Dissatisfied and Disappointed.;
Need other means to login apart from insta. I do not have insta id.;
Too many garbage feed... Please optimise your algorithm like the one use on Facebook or Instagram...;
when i first enter the app big app glitch just happen;
Knock off dollar general versiom of Twitter.;
;
Looks like twitter clone;
The app is super cool and I love its features ❤️❤️🧡;
M#C jukerberg Wasting Times of Fool Peoples & Earning Money 😏;
No concept;
Best app;
Kinda boring.. missing a lot of features or is hidden in the UI, can't find the trending topics for the life of me. The UI looks simple, too simple;
Total waste of time, nothing new thing 😞;
;
If you login this app 5 later your account got hacked Instagram;
;
Stupid, Twitter is goat;
Mine keeps crashing when I @, quote or add a photo, tried uninstalling reinstall restart phone..... Nothing on Google to say what the issue is. Phone works fine with all other Meta apps;
Good first draft. It runs smooth and I am sure they will be adding functionality. I don't think they expected so many downloads right away but yet it doesn't crash. They seem to have only rolled out what has been well tested. Also, it's not filled with weird vaguely eugenicist posts by the billionaire owner, so that is cool.;
They don't support freedom of speech if your view does not align with them you will get banned I wouldn't recommend using it;
;
Nah elon better;
haven’t seen any bug untill now but the scrolling animation is too much laggy and it feels too much annoying. this should be 120fps like meta's other app.;
Threads crashes everytime when I post photos. I use Android.;
;
Complete disaster. On top of that it doesn't let you take it off of your phone because IG might go too. Doesn't let me upload some pictures and I sent notification 2 times and nothing.;
;
Great Instagram texts based conversation app Really amazing 😍;
Poor Knockoff of Twitter;
Fun to use, but can't post gifs;
;
Best memes app;
What is this app, twitter basically but with censorship;
The pest app;
Just include hashtag & Trending features. It will be better than twitter;
The app is great but not for those who have the version below android 9,, cause whenever I try to open the app.The app's home page becomes glitchy and scramble,, So this is a matter of regret to the meta authority that they should have be more senciere before launching the app,, though its a bug associated problem,,,,;
complete twitter knockoff that looks irrelevant AF;
Better than Twitter;
Forgot your download;
Hmm nice;
;
If you're using this aap don't use it . If you connect this to your Instagram profile nothing happened. If you deactivate your threads profile . You see many issues on your Instagram profile . I'm facing that problem. . don't use this worst app . Non worthy ......;
This is good app and my ID inda_likhari;
Better than Twitter 😊😍;
This app froze first, then it got repaired, and afterwards, my Instagram is missing so many posts from feeds. I've reported multiple times, still no result.;
eehh fine app eh looking really sharp looking good look at your app shiny;
I'm facing a great problem from today. I can't see whom I'm following on threads and even can't see my threads and replies that I've posted on my threads account, my following and followers number isn't correct instead it's showing my Instagram account's numbers! Please fix it fast!;
It's got a long way to go yet. Not ready;
I dont want to see algorithmic content at all, but the userbase and integration with Instagram is nice;
Best app and better than Twitter 🤠 I loved it 😸.;
;
;
;
why is it glitching so bad? i cant enjoy the app pls fix this problem;
;
No creativity It is a copy of instegrm.🤬🤬;
Amazing app;
It's glitching every time I open it;
Bugs.... Everytime I open the home page... It keeps blurry and showing some duplicating effect of texts.... Still needs more improvements;
Perfect;
It's a great app and it's really easy to navigate but there's still a lot to be done.. Add a Message Button, Add Tags in Search, Add in settings where one can disable or enable Public Replies, that should be private. Thanks;
;
Yeah this sucks. Where's the NSFW artist where's the fun in that? I believe it's going to die quickly like NFTs I just don't want the servers to die down from Twitter. I have a great time on Twitter than this I don't even think of. They'll update later wish they probably won't because the creator who made this is an idiot that doesn't have one for PC which ruins the purpose of what Twitter and Instagram have;
Great Concept 🥰😇😁;
;
The name is funny, but it is convenient to use.And it's like a Burmese word(ခြ).;
Good app;
;
Great design and all, but has a lot of bugs. It behaves weirdly on Android 9, unusable..;
When i open this app its just glitiching for every time.. I canot login in this app with my insta account...!;
Its too bad ....m kya khamakha.... just like this;
Worst app of all times;
Beautiful app;
;
Ok! First of all change the that deleting thread account will delete Instagram account too ...;
;
doesnt load , all laggy , experienced like someone hacked my phone lmao , uninstalled it after;
;
;
;
extremely buggy not worked for a single minute;
It crash like hell;
;
Not bad app😉;
Good app;
It's a good app but it consumes a lot of data just like Instagram;
;
As of launch there is no way to sort your feed chronologically and no way to show just people you follow on your feed. As a result of this your feed is nothing but celebrities posting psusdo self help positivity and major brands trying their hardest to make painfully unfunny posts to get clicks. At the present there aren't true ads but when your feed consists primarily of brands and corporations making constant posts with no way to get away from them it's kind of the same thing but worse.;
Biggest size app. Please reduce size.;
;
this app NEEDS IMPROVEMNT.. there's no translation yet.. i follow korean authors in threads, and i need to screenshot their post and go to Papago app just to know what they have posted..;
Nice aap thanx u;
;
;
;
;
;
Twitter is better 🐦;
I'm trying to switch my account to private but it's not working... Not satisfied 😕;
;
;
It's a good app. My only concern is that it ruins the resolution of the gifs and short videos I uploaded. They end up blurry when I posted them.;
Dont download this app if you want to let your instagram work properly, as I have downloaded this app and started my profile with the same username as in my insta. But after 24 hours my insta app start getting CRASH , However when I logged in with different account on my insta app it works properly.;
Super 👌 nice 👍 It looks like similarly Twitter .;
Keeps closing when typing. I'm using a Huawei P30 and it just closes when typing, more often when typing @ then a name but it's mega frustrating. I'm giving it a 3 because of this. Otherwise it's a fantastic new app and the absence of DMs is an absolute winner and game changer.;
I think thread is completely broke the record;
Why when I use it , it's glitching . I did screenshot it. Does my device not compatible. It can't be, cause I'm able too download & play games like genshin impact, etc .;
I having trouble about logging in using my Instagram account.;
stop stealing Zuckerberg;
Despite the fact that the app is still developing, I don't see the reason why it keeps scrambling up when I try scrolling through the threads. This needs attention pls.;
This app better than Twitter;
;
;
;
i love it;
;
;
"Everything is smooth, but is there an update happening? Couldn't seem to open the ""following"" nor ""pending"" tab. I hope it'll be fixed! And also, add ""my liked posts"" tab, and a feature for hiding some posts/threads from specific followers only to be viewed, if that's okay. Overall, I love the new social media!";
Twitter is far better than this;
Excellent app by the meta.🇮🇳🌏;
Good application acchi performance best app;
please add polls/edit text, also improve the algorithm, i followed many people but i still get so many random threads that don't match my interest or anything from random people;
Best your application;
Much better than Tw(a)tter, the blue bird😸😸😸;
When I installed this app it doesn't work properly and work like it's hanged my screen doesn't work properly in this app, and I was trying to work properly automatically from 2 days but it doesn't .;
I am enjoying it so far but please make it so you can change between profiles!!;
attractive app, good👍;
Crashes like no other!! I could hardly. Post any thing without crashing every single time!!;
;
;
Buggy at the moment, I've not been able to post pictures.;
;
My threads was so hanging;
I need message like Instagram so I don't need to open other apps to share any threads;
Nice app 👍;
;
The app is not displaying properly;
Need messages options like Twitter 😍😍😃😃👌👍;
App crashing after trying to share photo from gallery to app, unable to filter follow only feeds...;
Security detected this app attempting to access my banking apps. CORRUPT and UNSAFE app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!;
It's a Superior Upgrade Version of Twitter. Welcome To Earth 🌎;
It was a good experience but I'm still going to stick to my other social media.;
This app is good but sometimes it's just give nofication like from 2 days and it's always make phone battery from 100 to 80;
;
One thing this app is good and it's on time where we'll get to see latest things more than Twitter. But one thing keeps me annoyed is that whenever I'm scrolling and a video pops out I always have to unmute and next video comes I still have to unmute like I just can't stop doing that. So that's the only problem I'm facing with this app so if that's fixed by next update I'm sure I'm gonna put 5 stars on that;
I think this app very great,keep update for new fiture;
I looked because of Selena Gomez;
;
Amezing app;
Good app;
Its not working while using on the tablets fix it please.Though it's working fine on mobile phones;
;
I also like this apps. Very nice;
App not load properly but overall it was better than Twitter I love it;
App is glitchy. It paints/blurs all over when i scroll;
Good innovation;
I don't even want to give one star After downloading threads my account is been hacked So never download this app The worst experience of this app 🙏🙏 i could not even find my account 😔 lwra app;
My thread isn't working properly please solve this problem;
Glitchy asf;
Much cleaner and not a mess like Instagram but copy of Twitter;
;
Wth is wrong with this app??? It showing glitch pages .. it doesn't deserve even a single star;
Really great;
;
One of the best app;
;
It's good for earned money;
Amazing app. Still need more features to take people off Twitter. Need to stand alone from Instagram, shouldn't be limited to users of Instagram. I don't like Instagram so much but I love the thread.;
Copy app;
;
Nice app🥰;
Good app;
Good experience instagram and also thanks for this ❤️;
Nothing is loading, none of my old threads are showing up and the app so just super slow in general. Uninstalling and reinstalling to see if that fixes it but I highly doubt it;
Best app;
This really is trash.. just another app to be irrelevent on and follow famous ppl as if they don't have our attention enough is a big NO for me.. if somebody gonna make another app atleast let it have some substance;
Its barebones twitter, hopefully they'll update the features quickly, will give 4 out of 5 untill then.;
This is good but not as twitter;
A platform to stay positive and find happiness at minimal things. Threaders Unite! Don't know for how long this positivity will continue to exist but right now it is at its optimal level, #KEEPONTHREADING;
Not working properly, all sections are getting disturbed;
Copycat app.;
;
;
Mere followers kyon nahin badh rahe;
;
;
Poor app;
Would be awesome to use without not having to sign up for Instagram 😔 wanted something other than Twitter and I'm sure many other people feel the same way;
Too much technical issues;
Very bad 😞 app no increase followers . 😭;
Awesome app❤;
This app is really mean to me as I found my role models here and they are posting mesmerizing content 🤍. Thank you 🙏;
;
Very nice app 🤠👍👍;
;
Not working smoothly, no option to login with email, it should be separately signup option without Instagram. Feed not working fine..;
Not bad;
Very good app;
Threads nice app and very fast gro aap and all guys install this aap thanks;
Why I see content second time in thread which I already seen in Instagram time wasting;
Totally disappointed ...;
I love it;
Keeps turning off;
can't upload photo;
;
I love it 😍❤️❤️. Good job Meta, ur team did a wonderful app.;
Good app Thank you sir mark jakarbug Follow my accout;
Boring app;
Just an useless add-on for instagram;
horrible booo dont do it 👎👎👎;
Better experience then Twitter.;
Super app;
;
Please delete my thread account;
;
suck;
Nice app;
Better than twitter;
Overall its super good but copying is not the answer;
Better than Twitter 🥰🥰🥰;
;
;
Hello developers i am not a user of instagram but want to use a threads please allow section for new signups rather than just login from instagram if its there then please make it more visible because I am not able to reach there;
Lit this app is crazy I just love this app;
So nice app;
;
Vry bad experience , app does not work properly;
One of the best thread apps. Thanks meta❤;
I like this 🖤🫀;
;
;
Sasta twitter;
;
Nice app..but i wish have online store;
;
Very good;
;
;
Very good but please donot limit the letters. It should unlimited.;
Good share;
Refreshing.;
Nice app in t his world;
The app is fyn;
It's just like twitter, nothing special in it !!;
Please add a save button;
Bored;
;
;
Nice app;
Trash.;
for a new app I think it's awesome room for improvement as time goes;
App is not stable;
Best app;
THREADS>TWITTER;
Please i need an answer ASPA is it true that if you delete or your thread account got hacked. Will your instagram account also be involved;
Twitter better;
This app is not useful and downloaded this app by cheating ,then we can not delete this app.;
Apps very good;
;
Marvellous;
It's a new app, and I believe it still needs improvement. While typing, the keyboard covers the text, which makes it hard to see what someone is typing. Also, I think it make a lot of sense of I can see people that follows me on their profile.;
Too much censoring;
Better than Twitter;
;
;
All Good But Refresh & Scroll Rate is To Much Slow Please Work On It...;
Very nice app, i am impressed with it very much and it's software optimisation.;
;
;
Much much better than twitter;
Better than Twitter;
Crashes when uploading a picture so what's the point in the app. Shouldn't of rushed getting it out;
It's a good social media platform this app may be helpful & easy to work it.;
Best;
;
;
There's an bug in this app on today;
Very bad experience withth the app it's shaking and getting blur over all display experience was very bad... !!;
Cool plateform I really impress bost business then this plateform right choose;
;
Love this;
able to access my emails, sms, and private messages? no thanks;
I'm really enjoying the app but I have a problem, my action is always blocked and anytime I try to add a photo before I post the app closes by itself. I don't know why it's happening but I wish you solve it, thank you.;
;
Beat app;
I love this 😻 so I want to try because someone tell me this is a good app❤️;
Best app 🖤;
;
;
;
It's a bad copy paste of Twitter;
Just copy the Twitter concept with low UI and features quality as social media app.;
So many bugs while writing keep showing my keyboards not keys, Fix that issue;
Look like instagram.;
Vary nice app;
Not so good , even now I can't delete this thread account from threads;
Its pretty average..more like twitter from 2007.;
"Not only are serious security shortcomings prevalent, but placing ""Post"" & other interactive buttons at the bottom of the page means they are obscured by QWERTY & Google keypads on most smartphones. By comparison Twitter has all functions top of page.";
The application keeps glitching since i open it, once i touch the screen it glitchs, can't use it at all;
;
Pretty darn solid option on the social media landscape;
This app is not working;
Can't cmt post on android, the keybroad hide the text input;
Twitter's dumb clone;
I'm very happy but you know what? I didn't become a member of this app today, I mean on the 10th. And I am giving a review without using the app. What's wrong? the thing😁😚😜;
We need more features like DM,modifie a post,boost;
Best experience ever;
;
;
Unhappy in this version;
;
It's a SPAM MESSENGER;
Perfect 🥰 deleted that silly bird app and will use this instead ❤️ mark is the best;
;
;
Crashed my Instagram account 🥲eew.;
;
Not working 😭;
I like;
;
so clean! i love how minimal the monochromic color pallete that was used.;
Better than the twitter app as I'm totally loving it!! ❤;
Very good using this app;
;
;
It is meaningless app;
It's a good platform for socialize as like Twitter. But Today after 6 to 7 hours of installing the app got closed till now it is showing try again. I uninstalled.;
Seems like Twitter;
Best 👍.lets introduce DM to own people.;
It keeps bugging;
Unrefined for a big corp app.;
Censorship;
Very basic and poorly interface;
;
;
It's so so;
;
What's the point of following people if their posts never actually show up on your home tab? Instead all I see is random people posting about how much they like Threads, so it really just looks like the app is trying to make itself look good without actually doing anything useful.;
;
Please do something. The app is not working. This app is horrible 😔;
Thank you meta nice 👍 app i like;
;
Rubbish App 😡😡😡 twitter is best ❤️;
"There's a lot to be desired for on this app I would like to see a ""This person follows you"" badge on someone's profile who follows me. A feed option of only accounts that I do follow. And most of all, being about to choose specific folders from my gallery to post pictures and videos from. The app is smooth, but uploading photos sometimes crashes it. Otherwise I can see this being a potential killer for Twitter.";
;
Looks like Twitter, but only shows you people and topics you have 0 interest in (unlike twitter) What did Meta do with all the data they collected on us?;
I hate this app 😮‍💨😮‍💨;
This app full copy with Twitter!;
Uhive still my favourite social media.;
Privacy is guaranteed in the app;
Worse social media ever Change those things 1. Deleting process 2. Username changing 3. Link account changing;
Worst app ever Zucky;
Worst experience ever, lags a lot. Just a bad copy of TWITTER.;
Copy paste and bad copy;
Its fun;
Fun, but lots of room for improvement, since its only a few days old will probbaly be much better over the next few months;
It works with only your current instagram. Why ?;
;
Awesome apps 😁🐱;
Trillion dollar company makes app that lacks basic features and will delete your Instagram account if you decide you no longer want their Twitter clone.;
Very simple easy to use and amazing applicationI'm looking forward to the live streaming and audio chat functionality between friends;
;
It's wonderful I like this 😍;
It's a good app but ever since I downloaded it my Instagram has never been the same I've been restricted and can't use my Instagram I don't remember going against the guidelines can you please make threads less connected to Instagram it really sucks;
The app crushes anytime I try to repost a thread or reply to a thread with a picture from my gallery;
Tidak bisa upload foto;
It's decent but why use data form Instagram Even if you have more followers from Instagram but moving to threads mean you probably have to start at square one, no limits here.;
Collects way too much data;
Lovely twitte For insta;
;
Glitchy Profile;
See I'm totally against copying the already great thing which is existing and using it as a rival. This is a waste of efforts by humanity, I think we should be more focused on inventing new ideas and spending our energy towards that incentive rather than copying things!;
;
;
;
Kya fayda yaar yaha bhi koi nhi pategi🥹;
Nice;
Bye bye twitter i am back to @Thread thank you so much;
Treads is better than Twitter;
Nice but copy;
Worst app I've ever used , not recommend;
Nice aap;
Hey brohh don't worry this app is safe for you ✌🏻🙃;
Boycott threads;
Glitch;
Just feels like a really bad clone of twitter with less features. Biggest killer is the lack of a web version. Deleted in less than an hour of downloading it. Even with twitter on the downfall with Elon's dumb decisions, its still wayyy better than what this is.;
Just made an account and the screen glitches out immediately. Texts overlapping each other, it's a mess. Will get fixed though i believe, but will uninstall it. Wanna send a screenshot, but here is no option. F.;
Better than Twitter,😎;
Arrogant expansion policies;
The app is good but instgram shall provide an option to delete the threads profile without deleting the instgram account.;
Too much boring.. jisko follow nahi Kiya uske hi posts dikh rahe hai... faltu jesa hai isme bi sab insta vali hi reels and photo post kar rahe hai kuch Naya nahi hai..ek chij 2 bar dekh ni pad rahi hai.. Isme option rakho jise follow kare usi ka dikhe😏;
Twitter is better..;
My application is crashing;
popular app with absolutely no use;
AMAZING APP;
It has been synchronized with the Instagram ID, which is very struggling process. I don't know those who don't have insta id, how they sign in to the app...?;
It very helpful to me.❤️🙂;
Arabic Should be Right Justified. Threads text, in languages other than English, should allow right-justify for people who write right to left. Otherwise, the default left-justified text looks unnatural to it's readers.;
i don't know why is it getting glitch!!! the page does not get loaded and so many pages at a time get opened!!!;
Awesome!!!;
App isnt working properly. It keeps showing glitches after entering dashboard.;
The Leftist Facebook tries to compete with Twitter, to mess up with a free speech. Uninstall it , throw it away, just like Target and Bud Light.;
Unusable. The app full of glitches, it's impossible to read even one post. Only posted photos are visible.;
Love the app way better then twitter;
Good;
Can't use it as I don't have an Instagram account. Not interested in Instagram so I'll just stick with Facebook.;
Nice;
The Best App;
The app is fun....but I have difficulties uploading pictures or videos..what could be the problem?;
Unaccepted error;
Love Meta ❤;
Theards 👍 > tiwtter👎;
I want to delete my account without deleting my Instagram. Deactivating isn't enough;
Worth App;
This app is great so far for me it's better than stupid twitter the ui is nice there's little to no bots you don't get any of the dumb people so far and they actually take moderation so far a little better than twitter actually allowing things instead of saying existing broke guidelines garbage;
While the app is a good one,I can't post media on it,anytime I try to post pictures and videos,the app just closes... It's frustrating!!;
Great alternative to the musky blue bird.;
Very nice 👍🙂;
Good 👍;
Okay, can we save images and edit posts please 😑;
Why this app have bugs? 😭 I can't use normally.;
When I opened the app, it's just like that I'm using Instagram.;
Make it at least to turn around on big tablets.;
this application is so cool I like it👍;
Nice App easy for communication but I hope to editing the App To add Direct Message (DM);
BETTER THAN Twitter;
Nice;
Beautiful App😍;
It's seems boring, no cool features;
Nice app;
Can't switch accounts, no feed for people you follow. Pretty rushed job.;
But I'm having issues mentioning @ or trying to post a write up all of a sudden it just goes off like it just disappear 😔😭;
Just download and open it. No big sign up headache. When you follow people you have to click the bell on the top right of the screen for their profile so you get their newsfeed. All in all so much better than twatter;
Hang appp;
please bring the translatation to the captions and replies.;
It shouldn't be compulsory to have other meta accounts to access Threads . Only then it can beat twitter.;
Useful 👍;
Downloaded only to give 1 star;
This app make my display overlapping but its not fault in display!;
A good app artist friendly but need more features like translate hashtags.. trends and many more;
Superb app good look Twitter sa acha hai yaha aap;
Good social media app ♥️;
Awesome app;
The apps is outstanding broo;
The app is too censoring. You can't have meaningful discussions.;
Not interested aap;
Twitter is the best twit in the world;
I m impressed for this app😊😎;
Worst app...lots lots lots of bugs;
good app like Twitter;
Very informative app.;
Good 👍;
Every single window is just overlapping on each other.;
Twitter is not good,but threads is good, very good, exilent;
Good;
Best;
This app is totally useless Twitter is totally better than this app;
Couldn't even explore the app because of this glitches. Even for a small touch it starts glitching. Couldn't rate more unless the bug is fixed.;
Bad experience I think. It's been 5 days of use of thread 🧵. I have got alot of problems using thread because we can't save photos here we cant enter and give a long space here that makes a problem. Along with that there are alot of problem this app can probably replace twitter in future 😔 yea I am also sad a out that but watching it's exponential growth over days I can easily predict it's potential in market. I hope thread can solve challenge user facing and makes a good user experience ✨;
Good one;
Nice apps;
Wonderful;
Good apps;
Good One;
"The app is good and all but I can't seem to post a new thread, anytime I try I get this notification ""your thread failed to upload "" please fix it for me";
Awesome application there are some bugs that need to fix but it's a great start;
Best app;
Good;
Good;
Why there's a lot of accounts showing in my feed even if I don't follow them????!!!;
what is wrong with having to press the speaker button if u want to upload a video huh?? the button is so tiny and most of the times users forgot to press that button... it's so stupid. Also, what is the purpose of following someone if we're gonna see random people's postings in our tl anyway?? Do not see where you are going with this honestly. Except for the smoothness of the UI, the UX is noticably worse than its' competitors.;
Not bad 😄;
Twitter is many times best than this app because it is promoting those who are already verified and famous on Instagram!!!!! Where should new people go????? They have no Rights to gain fame?????;
Great;
I love that clean and convenient User interface. Keep it up.;
This is nice social media app;
Lack of features;
Great app, but I had issue posting on my wall. The app closes as soon as I picked a file to upload. Any suggestions?;
Worst app tbh as soon as I opened the app all the content was overlapping each other I couldn't even use it.. I installed it again but still the same;
Great potential;
The app is very good but it have a glitch in dark mode, whenever I scroll the words get over written, this is the only problem for me, otherwise it's fine.;
So far so good;
Good;
This is a best ever social media app.;
Very fantastic app;
Application is crashing while uploading picture. Can't upload even a single picture of small size. What the hell????;
Wow nice app;
Not working at all. Neither feed nor profile is working properly!!;
I love it.;
Awesome app I use this app and injoy this.;
Ui are good and intuitive, anyway the community not large enough and cannot search or see the trend of the hashtags.;
Super;
I am very much impressed by using the app, so I will tell you the same thing, you should also do it by downloading this app. 🙆;
So. Nice App;
Nice app;
Good;
So funtastic;
The program does not want to be downloaded 😭;
Its good app;
Absolutely better than Twitter;
Failed to upload multiple pictures in a thread.;
Very good;
Bad;
"Wasn't able to login with my Instagram account. The app keeps saying ""unknown network error"".";
It's so simple and easy to use with no ads it's literally the best rn;
Garbanzo, looks like MySpace had a bastard with Twitter. Terrible UI and nothing relevant.;
App is full of glitch. Fix it please.;
The App always force close when I Start thread...🥲 Oppo Reno3 Android 12;
not a single person I follow shows up on my timeline, just 3rd rate influencers. no option to see only those I follow? also when replying, I can't see my own prompt, the keyboard covers it...;
Gathers a ton of unnecessary data + can't delete account without deleting your insta account.;
Nice app;
I think this app is great;
Finally got it;
It's great, just wished it had dark mode and the ability to switch accounts without the app glitching out. I don't want to keep uninstalling to fix it.;
Good;
Better than twitter;
I had error and doesn't work for me;
Really great app. Obviously better than Twitter.;
Really so nice app.. I like itt. And thanku for you make this application;
Good;
It's too bad;
The whole thing is broken or bugged. Texts are overlapping... Please fix it.;
Best social media more time better than twitter;
App crashes when uploading photos;
Worst social media app;
For a while I give one star, because this application does not have a system to restore hidden thread badges on the Instagram profile. If there was, I would give 5 stars.;
Better than Twitter.;
very good app;
The algorithm is horrible & and it's a horrendous copy of Twitter;
I am try login to this app but all time error show . I am unable to login in any way for these three days. Please solve this issue.;
Overall, the app is good. Its performance is great for it being initial release. A few suggestions: -Ability to only see followed accounts on timeline -Trending page -Cover photo -Dark mode Pros: -My system font works on this app, while it doesn't work on other similar apps.;
Toxic algorithm. I prefer twitter;
Worst app ever;
Good;
Nice this;
It sucked. Already everything you say is censored so you can't even have an actual conversation. No thanks I will stick with Twitter.;
Why my thread is not function properly! What is this???;
Great app, easy to use.;
This app is glitching on phone... Kindly check for bugs and correct it !!!;
Good;
I got bugs and can't use the app properly, the texts and the images starts to flow and my entire screen gets filled with the floating texts as I scroll through it. Please look into it;
I see no advantage of using this instead of Twitter;
Twitter better;
Totally worse thing on social media.;
Best;
Super app;
I have struggling with the bug and glitch. It is not convenient to use, i did reboot my device and re-install the app but nothing changes.;
Please help to Fix upload failure;
Working Amazing;
keep crashing;
Good app;
Ok but no cool features especially for genz;
It's got potential, but it's bland and boring so far without many features , and locking people in via Instagram isn't cool.;
Not bad but still this app is connected with Instagram and I don't like this feature;
Good experience 👀✨;
That's good app;
Literally it gives a great experience It is more better than any social media app;
Potentially brilliant, but at the moment there are just wwaayy too many posts from accounts I do not follow filling up my feed. Not sure it's chronologically presented either which is a massive killer for me.;
Great to use also secure form spam and online abuse , cyberbullying;
good;
This app is better than Twitter;
Osm so nice aap lovly to gooood;
Nice app , we need dark mood asap;
Nice app but unlike Twitter, we can't download the pictures and videos. Thats a deal breaker for me. Hopefully this option changes, because this app could definitely beat Twitter.;
Excellent app, prefer it to the alternative, freedom of speech shouldn't mean hate speech is allowed. 2 suggestion , please add theme option to edit to dark mode and threads should resime from last read instead of most recent threads. Thank you;
Great app. Would have give 4 stars but gave 5 to get ratings up. Lol;
CANNOT SEE FOLLOWING , ITS ERROR FIX IT;
This good experience for this app;
Languages should be translated down,edit of the post and download;
Better than Twitter !!!;
Waaaaay too many app permissions;
Can't post photos;
I am so excited as using the new app;
Something slowly apps;
overall is good, but please fix when i will post media, the apps goes to so laggy. So i hope it's get fix;
Idk can only give one bcz this app need to shows the whole replys comments and fix bugs;
Useless....;
Really good aap I just want a aap which can replace Twitter and look here it is;
Nice apps good;
Please solve the glitches in this app I can't use this app for so many glitches Please solve it quickly;
I cannot delete my account;
Nice;
Can't delete my account from this garbage;
Worst experience. Trying to upload the post since yesterday, 'Thread failed to upload' message pops up every time. Really frustrating. Did all the thing like , cleared cache, OS update n all. Still pathetic experience. These kind of things wasn't expected from a Meta product.;
Soo good😛😇😇😇😇;
Amazing apps;
"Well designed, easy to use, but it's refusal to allow any content that could be labeled ""nsfw"" makes it an easy pass as a true Twitter alternative. Political or personal opinions aside, without some sort of option to allow content in that category, it will continue to needlessly kneecap it's self. No normal person is going to use both apps, and way more then are willing to openly say it will continue using Twitter for this reason alone.";
You can't see the text input window when replying. It is covered by the keyboard making it so you can't see what you are typing.;
Very nice app;
First time open bugs 😂🤣;
Search function only searches accounts, not posts or keywords. Useless. The timeline is all influencers, sports, and celebrity accounts w/ high traffic. I barely see the posts from accounts I'm following! After muting unwanted accounts my timeline has not changed in the last 12 hours and I can only continuously scroll thru the same handful of posts from yesterday. No option to view posts I've liked or bookmark things to revisit later. I know it's early days but these are critical features.;
It buging a lot when I install it and get irritated. When I try to scroll remarks of previous page left behind and can't read other thing please fix it;
Ever best satisfied application it is,besides extra facilities remain here😊;
Good career;
Worst;
My threads are having a bug or technical problem.;
The potential for a good app is there, but it's not good yet. Most notably, the front page is filled almost exclusively with people you don't follow. App is literally unusable until a following-only feed is implemented.;
Good;
Well i have 3 account on insta My name as firsrt and another two as sub account soon i creat accout on threads it give one of the two sub account as profile, i cant find any possibility to change my account name or picture.. Thank you in advance Regards,;
Nice app better than twitter;
nice;
Good;
Nice 👍👍 app;
Super app like;
Great alternative to Twitter. They still need to clean out the bugs, though. It's a little rough.;
Amazing;
Good 👍;
It is easy to use, and it isn't a hell scape like Twitter.;
Mine is not loading(opening) again after I used it on the first and second day, what could be the reason?;
"Terrible experience, the whole algorithm time line is the absolute worse, i am inundated with thousands of UTTERLY MALIGNANT USELESS ASININE content from""creators"" that i could not careless if they imploded, i spend more time muting accounts than i do posting anything, i don't care about this new feed I'm being fed, i can't search for content i actually care about, this app as it is, is absolutely irrelevant, that being said the interface is straightforward and posting is easygoing. D-";
Need a lot of improvement;
Okay;
better than twitter;
Super app;
Good 👍👍👍👍;
This app not reach my expectations not good interface not useful at all;
There's much needed features missing on launch, such as dark mode, but with time I can only see the app improving. Until then, 3/5.;
Stupid app, privacy zeroooo;
Thanks for making this app;
Amazing application like Instagram i loved it 🫶💯;
Nice;
Wow thanks this app very nice ☺️;
Threads is a copy of Twitter. Nothing new. I have a idea for something that better than Twitter.;
Awesome 😎;
Very amazing and wonderful 👍;
I signed up with Instagram and then installed threads. In Threads, I muted several posters. I did not post in either app. but, a warning popped up that I had violated Community standards. currently apparently disagreeing with the algorithm is a violation of community. if I wanted complete lack of control I would go back to Twitter.;
Better than Twitter;
Boring;
Good;
Was beginning to enjoy it until I started constantly seeing post by someone I'm not even friends with. Literally every four posts there they are. It's not my page it's their page now I'll check back in on it sometime in the future when more friends are on;
This is very awesome ❤️ love it;
This app is nothing special other than hiding and filtering the truth that must be known u can not express ur opinion freely on here and the home and the idea is all a taken idea so I call it a copy paste but I give it a F because the filtering is making my blood boil I want to have a free opinion;
The app is very big crash, full of bugs, but it's good to see Instagram is trying something new fantastic keep it up;
Good;
Lovely 👈❤️❤️❤️👌app;
Worst;
This app was not installing;
Crashes too often;
crashed at least 30 times, every time I try to upload a picture it stops.;
Big like;
To many permission for an app;
I can't umfollow it keeps telling sorry pls try again later ... Please work on this issue;
Put first post on with a few pictures all great. Next day it will let me write a post but not add photos;
Keep getting fail to upload have cleared cache but still not working;
For a brand new, its very well optimized, its like twitter😘;
Very good threads aap;
So far Because this app is boring like Instagram app Twitter is best;
Very good application;
Nice app . Is it so cute then twitter??????;
I want to like it. But it only let me posts pics for one day before going back to crashing every time I try....;
Best;
Yikes;
Nice app;
I'm loving the app, the only fix i want apart from bug fixes is some control/filter over what we see on our feed. I don't even see the threads by people i follow, and don't wanna see random lame meme pages.;
Nice 👍;
Okay app;
Buggy;
I can't post a picture, why??;
App is good however I wil recommend not to start an account in thread as we don't have an option of deleting just thread account. If we want to delete this account we have delete whole Instagram account which doesn't seems to be perfect way. If you see they are forcing us to stay in this app whatever may come. It's a pure scam. Hence requesting you kindly decided before you start an account. As you can't go back 😢;
Not bad not bad;
Good app;
Nice app for usage;
Good;
I love this app ❤️❤️❤️ (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠);
Wow nice app🔥;
It is a good app and overall good concept but I guess it is better if u add chat option and stories with the new updates. This is just the beginning. I hope we will see good later;
Good;
Great app🥰;
Overlapping and is threads working in android version;
Amazing;
Downloaded after not working Instagram properly, anyone facing same problem?;
Great to use;
It's pretty good if you have an insta account. There's not too mquch difference from Twitter;
Perfect;
Nice 👍 beautiful;
Algorithm for the feed needs a lot of work. I'm seeing the same threads day after day at the top of my feed even if I've seen them half a dozen times already. A lot of random junk I don't care about.;
My Instagram video not playing when I installed 😡😡;
Hot garbage;
Very dead application not working properly.☹️☹️😠😠😡;
Not working on redmi note 6 pro. Overlapping text issues on scroll.;
Literally insane ! A good competitor to 🐦 :);
Gooooodd;
Not good like Twitter;
So far so good, app is easy to use, tho it would be nice to be able to choose the photos from their folder instead of scrolling all the way down just to post it in the app;
I say only, it's very nice app Thanks META;
While uploading photos, it keeps getting kicked out of the app, while uploading photos, it shows that the photos are not coming in the form of files or positions, all of them come together, so many problems are faced.;
Wow good app♥️;
Wayy better community and content than its competitor (twitter);
Easy to handle easy to use;
Didn't even load on my android device.;
Better than Twitter.;
It's clearly rolled out in a haste, but I appreciate the people who worked on this app. There is no method to add more than one profiles which we can toggle between on Instagram. So if we have 2 profiles on Instagram u can only use one. Hope this will be resolved soon.;
Best platform;
Nice;
Super app;
This is not a high quality app. In this, the post of useless people comes to your home without calling you, picture editing facility is also not available in this.;
Worst app;
Good;
Fix the bugs it's been days and I am not being able to use it;
Not optimized for phones with smaller screens.;
Best app;
1 star because my feed is full of suggested rubbish that I don't want to see just like Facebook and Instagram. I should only see posts from people I follow. Im sick of meta throwing complete nonsense on to our newsfeeds;
My tread having bug/glitch this is why my thread don't work anyway so please check it out and repair it! My Instagram I'd :- abuu.talibb;
Features requests & bugs (so far) : - notification scrolling is very limited - only full gallery is available when looking for a file to attach - no ability to just switch accounts (you have to log out every time) - no dark mode (please for the love of my retinas!);
Wow lovely 🌹;
Very bad;
Good;
Booooring!!!;
Good;
Good;
Why I am having bug?;
Good;
Excellent app, work very smoothly ☺️👍 well-done!;
The app scrolls slowly and it does not work properly in dark mode;
Unusable mess, literally cannot read/see anything because of a bug;
How will i change it to dark mode;
Better app from Twitter 😂😂;
Easy to Use and batter than Twitter i love this app;
glitched, and choppy;
Therads crashed on my phone;
Worst app;
Very nice 👍👍🙂;
Worst app, 😭 fully glitched screen.;
It's too bad It's not working I don't want to rate it at all;
When I upload images the app crashes;
Awesome, helpfull app. Better than Twitter;
"This app is good but here no option to ""PHOTOS""🖼️ save in gallery.";
Most informetic app;
I can't understand how to use this app;
Nice;
This is very safe careful and video reel &photo amazing in view app is very nice is future and technology very nice;
Too good 👍🏻😊;
Why do I see so many irrelevant threads? The feed is a huge mess;
Very good app bro like twitter dad 🥵🥵🥵✅✅✅;
Not impressed;
Wow;
Nice;
the app pop up and bug again😑please fix it !;
Perfect!;
Absolutely a very gud app coz many of their acc got hacked so it can help easily to find hackers;
Very bad experience 😔;
What the hell man i can't use threads whenever i scrools it It just skits all the time i can't even read it whats written can't even see what a waste;
Good 👍;
Enjoying Threads;
So far is very nice, but I am hoping to see integration of hashtags like twitter;
If there is a trending section, and a hastags section then it will be alright 👍 Overall interesting 🤔;
Buggy app the display is shattering;
Great 👍;
Love it;
Awesome 😍;
The application will not let me create an account, And the easy log in through Google does not work.;
There is a screen glitch in my threads account. Try to solve the glitch (Device:- Redmi note 6 );
Bug fix 😓;
App constantly crashing when trying to comment on threads, also whenever tagging an account it's just crashes straight away. Huawei P20 Pro.;
Wow Excellent;
Very nice apps;
It's just like twitter I guess but the glitchiness is making it almost completely unusable. If I could upload a photo of what it looks like I would. It's headache inducing.;
Won't let you log in without an Instagram account.;
I love this app;
Great twitter alternative, just have no idea why I'm seeing the whole world's posts and not just those posts from people I follow?? I don't want to see posts from those I don't follow, how do I change to see just those posts from people I follow?;
"You can not criticize the app... The level of hypocrisy they are doing in terms of creating a social media app.. if you try to post any post with word ""bug"" or similar it will block you to do.. Better they don't call ita a social media call it restricted media app";
I just tried to upload a picture captured from the camera, but this app keeps crashing.;
Good 👍;
Love it;
Very poor app;
Nice features and easy to use.;
Good app;
Better Than Twitter;
Nice app over all;
Not working at all...app is crashing a lot can't see any posts;
This app not downloaded;
Well I installed the app out of curiosity and it seems interesting but whenever I open the app, it's all glitch. I'm unable to see a single word perfectly and everything is just messed up on screen. Hope you resolve such bugs and issues soon and be able to provide a great user experience.;
Excellent app;
Not bad;
Real buggy. I can't even upload a photo without it crushing. Back to Twitter it is.;
I can't attach a photo. Once I selected from Galary then press ok. The app keep on crashing and just went down. Again and Again same situation. Please fix this frustrating issues.;
It's good but needs more feature updates;
Great!;
I can't post anything on threads. It just closes up. Fix it please;
Sometimes I can post pictures and sometimes it crashes the app. It'll be better when the bugs get worked out for a new app.;
Worst experience, my Instagram account logouts automatically as soon as I login to threads;
Happens to glitch everytime i enter the app💀;
It's glitching everytime I open the app I hope it's fixed soon!;
Easy and smooth like cream;
The app is cool But I couldn't access my photo folders It's a newly launched app, so there's still room for improvement;
It is not working well..it hangs..;
Overall a good experience so far, however could be improved. I have only used it for a day but inability to properly search by topics makes me feel like I see posts which are irrelevant to me than the posts which I can relate to. It would be helpful to have hashtags available but I understand that at the moment, the app is a new launch and still has a lot of development to go through. Hopefully will be able to give five stars in the future.;
Worst app Twitter is better than threads and Twitter is better optimized its run smoothly on my device and on the other hand threads is lagging littlebit in my device copy paste is not the best solution and if you try to uninstall it your Instagram account gonna deactivate i cant even DM my crush;
Uploading photos is always a problem;
Not at all working lots of bugs error while using;
It's okay but, I don't like how pictures appear.. not full size of monitor wigth;
There's no room for mail or chat on thread directly;
Constant app bug;
I love the clean interface and the lack of pointless config however why is my feed filled with people I don't follow??? I've tried the suggested work arounds and they don't work;
I love the idea but recently I've been unable to access my followers list. Keep saying I should try again. Its really hindering the smooth flow I was enjoying for the first few days.;
The app is great but it keep stopping everytime I attach a picture to the thread.;
I like it but it does need some improvements like more private settings like there should be a option to hide my replies from people while having my profile in public simliar to the twitter circle like that;
My homescreen is just a pile of posts from accounts that I don't follow, never heard of, and don't want to see. I'm completely uninterested in all these posts. And there's no way to only see see the accounts you follow--you're forced to see all the junk. Why would anyone intentionally want junkmail?;
This app is terrible. Nothing works correctly, even on a S23 Ultra. Very useless. Not enjoyable whatsoever.;
this app is annoying! i try to delete my account, you cant. i try to remove that number from my bio you can't. this is wrong.. i should able to add and delete apps if i wanted to!!!;
Once I open the app, it starts glitching. I have installed and unistalled 3 times now. I can't even scroll the TimeLine or go to profile.;
Lag;
It's not that bad but there's a little problem in it. I want to edit my bio and import it from Instagram but it keeps saying there's something went wrong. I need help if you read this.;
There is no option to edit typo mistakes. I can't see where to add a video. In fact, I can't see where to add or post anything! Managed it once but don't know how? My icons seem to be missing! Using tablet and tried phone! Doesn't flow for me! I'll wait until it works properly before I invest too much time with it!;
Cannot even log in, just keeps coming up with error, u installed.;
Same poor data collection practices as other Meta apps Battery drains much faster with this app in the background potentially due to larger data collection pool than other apps Lacks lots of engaging features and currently prioritises posts from creators established on Instagram rather than followed accounts;
Great onboarding experience! I already like it way better than Twitter. The app works smoothly and is well-designed.;
App-breaking screen bug where it looks like multiple different screens are all overlaying over each other and you can't see anything. Scroll and it gets 100x worse;
Extremely buggy. I can't even scroll without every screen overlapping on top of each other and creating a mess.;
Liked it until today when it started crashing. Right now, it won't open at all.;
Stagnant Glitches when i scroll the page up and down;
Very nice app I'm enjoying the nice interface;
don't work voice fromvideos ... tap 2 voice button every time;
Needs search, hashtags, some way to curate your feed. It just shows celebrities and influencers, discovery is weird.;
Here to spite Elon lol;
Bad;
Sometimes I load it and it closes down. I cant use it.;
This is a lousy attempt to steal Twitter users but it won't work once people realize all the big name people featured as new users are revealed to be payed for their joining this POS app;
Better than twitter;
Meh, there is a lot of other threads that i have scroll past to find people I follow. Adding those accounts to the block list doesn't diminish the amount of unwanted theads. The plus side is that if you have a pretty extensive sponsored ads block list in IG, that was carried over.;
App lançado de qualquer jeito. Basicamente pegaram a parte de comentários do Instagram e colocaram ali. Não tem filtro para poder escolher de quem que tu quer ver as coisas, não tem como ver só de quem tu segue e toda hora aparece uma postagem de algum comunista falando bobagem. Na prática, é um lixo de app. Não tem como excluir a conta depois de criar, totalmente em desacordo com a LGPD;
Good app;
Hanya instagram dengan tambahan fitur bisa share link outpost. Perpaduan Twitter+IG+Anggota Fesbuk;
Can you please make it so that we see posts from who we follow instead of everyone and their mother?;
Copy past twitter;
Horrible app, horrible experience. Just a copy of another successful app.;
Very impersonal feeling UI, in it's current state this app feels more like a barebones Instagram copy rather than an extension of it.;
Amazing;
Threads is a son of Twitter;
Cant able to install why its nt working;
Needs some more years to be perfect.;
The only reason I'm giving it a three star is because when you follow people they don't show up on your feed it's a bunch of random users other than that the app itself is pretty cool;
Good;
It's crashing on my phone (motorola z2 force);
Horrible Chinese copy 🤮🤮🤮;
Following features is useless! I still saw something that I dont wanna see. Should I block every random post? Feels like spam to me. Your algoritm sucks kinda IG and FB. Adopt by twitter, add features between following and recomendation! So You can add ADS on recomendation features!;
This app is great and all, but the one key thing that's missing that's also on Insta is the option to easily switch from one account to another.;
to much bug & glitch;
Crashes when I try to upload a picture;
I went to use;
Can't download pictures?;
Very easy to use;
Great;
While it's not Twit-ler, it's still Meta. I'll give it a spin if only to stick my finger in Elon's eye.;
"Well, So far, I like it.. Still figureing it out..;)";
😍;
I just installed the app. But when I try to open it it crashes.;
It does not work;
Honestly didn't use it. It would just be funny to watch Elon lose $44 billion.;
It's a Great app;
IG gwcke hack karena ni apps sial!!;
Very useful app;
Do more updates!!;
There's a big glitch problem on interface. But I solved it. When I turn off dark mode app is working normally. But it's not the solution. I don't like the light mode. Please fix this.;
Very ⁶⁶⁷;
Nice;
Big ups;
I like the concept, and it's good to start. However, it needs to be easier to follow people in your feed without opening the post and harder to highlight text. I kept accidentally highlighting while scrolling and clicking on posts when trying to follow someone.;
It's an all-around unsatisfactory experience. I wish it were fully separate from Instagram without requiring an Instagram account.;
This app is not safe, it's literally letting me see people's phone numbers!!! You're being exposed!!!!;
Adakah yang appnya tampilan kayak matrix juga? Nge-hang walau udah diuninstall berapa kali. Apakah karena hpku yang kentang? Tapi aplikasi lain gak ada yang kayak gini nih. Udah daftar akun threads tapi gak bisa dipake😌;
Good tackle 👍;
ایدی ترزد و از قسمت بیو اینستام پنهان کردم الان میخوام درستش کنم دیده بشه نمیدونم چجوریه میشه راهنماییم کنید🙏;
ᴄᴏᴏʟ ᴀs ᴜ ʟɪᴋᴇ ɪᴛ;
It's better than Twitter, and I barely used Twitter.;
Far better than Twitter 👍😀;
It's needs more improvements to look pretty and warm;
I'm currently experiencing a challenge posting threads to my Instagram feeds. I was able to do so this morning with no hassle but of late I only have the option to post to either my IG stories or Twitter. Can anyone assist?;
Please create scheduled content for this app too;
Very boring;
It's just like Twitter but worst since you always get censored.;
threads is good so far but theres a few features it lacks which should be added: - option to bookmark threads - following certain topics so that we can customize our algorithms and homepage other than that its rlly good!;
Bad I got hacked;
Awful twitter ripoff with half the features. To top it off you can't delete account without deleting your instagram. Disaster;
Horrible could not keep app open.;
Great experience;
I might just stick to Twitter;
Full of glitches 😡👎;
It's all in a language I cannot understand and changing it has not been easy. Just seems like a copy of twitter just not as good. Why would anyone need this when we already have twitter? Why do we need so many social media apps???;
Can't get through the setup process. I want to manually select who of my Insta followers to follow in Threads, and twice now I've spent a fair while going through the list only to have it shut down when I get to the end before I can continue to the next stage. It reverts back to the start, and I have to redo my profile and select everyone again only for the same thing to happen. I don't have time for this.;
Bestie;
Hope elon is proud!;
The only problem I have with this app is you can't choose your username it automatically takes it from your Instagram. I feel like I was early enough to this app where I could finally get the username that I have on YouTube. Or even a username for my band. But I can't because Instagram....;
Copied the form factor of twitter but the functionality is not quite there yet;
Can't use without Instagram account;
When will it be able to get for Kindle Fire? ...I can only get on my phone;
It is very bad app 😠😠 data waste pura app hila hua he;
Threads app is of the best app in the world 🌍;
Good;
👻👻👻👻rubbish app;
I don't want to see threads from people I don't follow;
I love this app and I hope everyone use this app and l am telling you guys threads is amazing we have appreciate this app;
Best of luck 🤞 Happy 😊;
I love it 🤩🤩🤩;
Good;
App keep crashing whenever I should upload a photo !!! Not a good start for thread !!;
It scrolls so slowly. I think the developers probably forgot that not everyone uses a phone with high refresh rate. It doesn't scroll smoothly like Twitter.;
Too much lagging 😔;
So nice to finally have a good substitute to Twitter. Basically the same but better.;
No feed settings, made for an absolutely terrible experience.;
I want to delete this account without deleting Instagram;
Twitter copy. Totally uninteresting;
Nice 👍;
Nice to meet you and threads in so nice appp;
Honestly this app is till in its testing stage, bugs on top of bugs;
please make threads lite mode;
What is the difference from Instagram and Twitter? Copy paste doesn't solve anything. You should have come up with an innovation. Downloading 100 m + is not a success like me most of them will delete the app and wont use it.;
So boring,same features we got on twitter also .;
laggy;
Good;
Keyboard covers letters on screen when typing. And add edit to typing options for one to easily alter writings with ease.;
Keeps crashing. Myspace would never do this to me.;
Was working fine. This evening it opens, then immediately closes. Glitch appears.;
Woow;
I would really like to be able to use more than one account. I have 2 IG accounts, 1 business and 1 personal, but can only use one on the app on my phone by just switching like on the IG app.;
This app is super kul 🎉;
Sub optimal;
It's very good 😊💯;
Required to have Instagram account as well? BS.... regardless if from I-Gram, should'nt be required to have an additional bloatware app.;
Op;

Ridlo (via mastodon) ----- Setelah saya coba sendiri, terbukti beranda dipenuhi postingan thread sampah dari akun centang biru YANG TIDAK SAYA FOLLOW, sedangkan thread dari akun teman-teman yang saya follow pada tenggalam.";
Crashes everytime I try to attach a photo.;
Not bad. Its pretty new with room for improvements.;
✅✅;
Overall experience is good but I have facing issues while uploading the photos ,that was very disappointed;
That's great 👍;
The interface is a big problem. Right from the point where a user logins in his or her account; the app feels cluttered.
I want to have it available on my Windows computer;
Zucc is cucc;
This app is awesome and please add photo save option and massenger opetion;
shoddy and useless app😡😡;
Copy of twitter;
Main NY abhi app download nhi JB kro gA to bTa Doo ga;
No 👎 like it 😂😂;
No other words, I like it 😌;
I spent $44 billion on Twitter and lizard boy hit copy and paste. Its personal now;
When we shall can use two or more accounts?;
good;
Worst Experience;
Copy paste;
Good app;
Very bad app;
When the app is loding all pages are overlapping en each other I don't know why. Sould you fix it;
This appe nice 🙂;
Can't upload photos on thread app;
😍😍😍;
Great app;
Thank you for open my account;
Not well;
Its wonderful it's just needs a little bit more improvement, like multiple pictures the second time you post because I posted multiple pictures the first time and now I'm unable to post more pictures including just one but I am able to upload videos which I think is weird I am also able to make regular posts with words only;
Twitter wannabe. Would give 0 stars if I could. Uninstalled immediately;
it is Cool!Nice;
According to me this app is good 👍😊;
Shaz;
😡🤬👹;
It's good but has a few kinks. It needs settings like an in-app dark mode instead of it being tied to my phones settings. Along with features like direct messaging. Ads don't seem too intrusive but I'd like to see more in my feed from people I follow;
😍;
Over all good. Please invest in making a dark mode.;
Lack of free speech, not engaging and the UI is horrible.;
Good, 👍;
Goood;
is there ever going to be a point where you can join this app without having an Instagram?;
Way better than Twitter.;
Good 👍;
This is frud app;
Nice app;
This is a beautiful app;
I have rated one star cuz actually I haven't used it yet , everytime i open the app it lags and it's terrible I can't use it cuz all things are in each others I can't describe anymore about my problem;
The app is crashing i sent 1 star if the bug has been fix I'll change it to 5 star;
Lame;
Mediocre users;
Good every thing needs competition;
Unic and outastending app;
I can't remove my threads id from insta profile.;
Awesome 👌🏼;
Good;
it's just twitter without politics and gore videos;
Ad hashtags option plz and trend;
good;
we need a dark mode;
Don't download it.;
please add Edit feature.. it's not user friendly if you have to delete then repost things again.;
What an app just waste of time no sense of using at all just copy of Twitter;
@jaishreeram;
💫;
Can we make it more user-friendly;
Best 👍💯;
It doesn't let me download 😭;
It's good app;
Super;
This is useful apps 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹;
Great app;
I don't have Instagram only Facebook, so I can't use threads ❓❓❓❓❓❓;
Nice app ✨💯;
Good;
Introduce Hashtags;
Privacy Pirate;
"Don't know how to say about this application. Similar to ""The Blue Bird""🤣🤣🤣🤣 but the difference that I found is No direct message and No Hashtag. No direct message is more new approach like whatever you do you says, goes public (but for private accounts goes to your friends and followers) BUT no Hashtag to search the topic we need. That's make me don't know of how to use this application anymore. (Keep it don't delete it people say it could affect Instagram's account. 🤣🤣🤣";
This app not properly working in my mobile showing glitch 😭😭;
Nice app;
The app has laging;
Bekkkaaaar farzi application h;
Nice Application;
Nice app💪👍;
Really great. I hope toggle between Insta eventually gets sorted out and a translate link would be great. Way better than Twitter. Very minimal hate speech & false information. Zuck did a fantastic job for its inital launch. Oh, and Elon still sucks!;
Plzz don't download this 🙏🙏 😒;
Accidently leave the app when writing a stitch? Gone! Forever! You're better off writing it in you own notes first. Want to see stitches of the people you follow? Good luck.;
App keeps crashing, hoping for a fix asap :);
GOOD MORNING;
It's v good;
Twitter<Thread;
Mast aplication for Instragram;
Good;
Very good app it's work like insta and Twitter both..,.;
Good, but it would be nice if there was a save feature so I can save a post if I want and I don't want to see posts in my feed of people or organizations I don't follow;
This is a very good app;
Rubbish at the moment. Not the Twitter killer people anticipated.;
K can't even touch anything on the screen;
YOU ZUCK;
This is Great , but still lok the same as twitter;
Perfect 🥰 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣;
Don't install this app;
Nice 👌 app;
Nice;
The best platform and the most used platform is much better than Twitter😒❤️🍷;
One star ayaw tanggapin account ko ayaw tuloyma open;
Twitter:Cttrl c , ctrl v;
I can't even use it without instagram;
Home screen of app is showing overlapping issues. I'm unable to use it. So bad 😞;
I would not trust a damn thing Facebook does, they are in bed with a Chinese their Marketplace is full of Chinese BS selling stuff you never received because they are importing fentanyl within these products that you never receive!;
The screen kept frozen.;
Very good app but just imprisonment need;
দিন দিন সামাজিক যোগাযোগ মাধ্যমের হার বাড়ছে তাই একটা অ্যাকাউন্ট খুললাম আর কয়টা খুলবো;
Better than twitter 🤣;
Super apo;
The concept of the app is good. But the app needs some optimization. There are some glitches in the app And it's draining my device's battery. So after some times, I need to fixed my battery issues. Make threads more compatible. Please fixed this problems as soon as possible.;
Worst lekin abb ise delete kiya toa insta bhi jayega;
App keeps shutting down when I try posting a pic.... not much use for it then! 😕;
Ismein followers;
You have your numbers now branded slaves;
Gandu app;
Nice;
What a legendary appp yoo iam enjoying it;
Good;
Mst app hai Bhai zuck lekin features add krona aur;
Op;
Computational is fine, cheating is not;
Looks cool, but it needs a lot of features.;
"People giving this 1⭐ are automatically from twitter and any opinions made about ""threads"" is inaccurate and illegal in all 197 countries";
We want this type of app to thread 🧵 and follow the legend all around our world.;
I'm on Android phone. Why can't I upload a pic to threads? I could yesterday. Now when I try to add a pic, the app just closes.;
cheap copy of twitter;
I can't even open a page properly I just installed it andbits glitching;
Good man....;
I don't see a point in this app. 1) I can't search for a specific post based on keywords. Or related topics 2) cannot know what is happening locally because there is no location based trends. 3) I don't understand the feed. It has nothing that I'm interested. I don't know why I'm asked to view those posts. 4) I cannot use the app to DM anybody.;
Please Fix the bugs, My Bio is not changing;
System 🤙;
Not bed;
I can't post keep saying failed;
I'm downloading this for the 5th time but this is not download my daily data packed total finished;
Boring 😞;
Why should I have a login ID of Instagram for this. Whatif I don't want an instagram profile? This is not making sense.;
you must have an Instagram account to use it..;
Great very beautifull;
Nice 👍👍👍👍👍;
Time waste;
It should have a translate option for comments and replies.;
This is one of the worst apps in the list of worst apps I ever used, I don't wished to be here just got here cause a friend asked me to and now I can't delete my account neither can I use this app and it is collecting some useless data that a chatting and connecting app doesn't require, I do wish it gets banned in India;
❤️🙂;
Ndjen;
Nice Aap No any Issues;
So slow...can't post even a photo;
Good;
awesome;
This is a copy of Twitter;
I like the threads app, it's just that please improve it again with a feature to be able to find out who people don't follow us back and, as well as have a dm feature, trending stories and using hashtags. thank you, I hope you read this.;
Copy past 😅;
Awesome;
The experience was not good. It is just second copy of Twitter..it was not expected that u have a app like insta still u are copying others..very dissapointing q;
dx;
Great 👍;
App is very good.It is blasting the bug and not even allowing me to open my lover page and what not.I cant see the excellent app like this till now.Itbuas everything.I am uninstalling everything now for this app.😁;
Worst copycat of twitter app;
BUG!;
This app is same as Twitter. nice app @rahulbatham0;
Useful;
Nice;
useless;
Gandu app;
Kuch samjh nhi aa raha avi;
Already better than the alternative;
Doesn't work !! If you upload a picture, the app freeze 😞;
Good app;
Poor app;
I love you ❣️;
So Cool Now elon bro feel so sad now i am sad because elon felling is sad;
This app is very nice but there are some major issues which needs to be fixed as soon as possible. Although app experience is Good;
Compitition is fine.cheating is not;
Really good;
Hang ho raha hai;
my threads account was verified core do instagram was verified;
Good;
Mark you need to stop stealing!;
Muy bonito pero twitter es mejor, más seguro y más serio;
😆😆;
I'm still learning why I need the app & how I can make it work for me... Haven't found my identity yet... However... Sometimes while leaving a thread of my own or commenting on someone else', I'll be randomly kicked out, as if I touched my minimize button, (which I haven't) & it's gone out of the post I was in & cleared what I typed. Most times I would loose the post completely... You can imagine how frustrating this is! 10 July, I had to re-type my own thread 4 times, as I kept being kicked out;
Nice aap;
Good;
Awful;
Twitter ki copy hai threads elon musk ko chalenge😂😂;
Make a storys and post option dont hide;
Nice;
Yo man # are not working;
F.. Twitter;
So Much Bugs In The App ! nothing Superb Features Copied Everything From Twitter;
This apps are very interested to work 😄;
Amazing more then to Twitter 💝😻;
I love this app for;
Best. Ap;
Crashes when uploading bigger photos. Zuck you can do better. Make the app more fun!;
Hii developer Good morning Is app me scroll view main,jo post aa rahi hai usme sound baar baar on karna pad Raha hi Thank you;
Nice experience ☺️;
It is an application without a purpose and an incomplete version of Twitter;
Waiting for when mark launch crypto network. Is mark leave anything for others;
"Annoying - 2 stars coz well done for copying Twitter but it's not allowing me to post a thread. It keeps kicking me out when I try to type. Un-installed and reinstalled ☕ and now it just keeps saying ""posting.... view "" can see everyone else's threads, just not my own feed. I find all of this monotonous. How do i fix this problem?";
Twitter is better, auto translater also not available.;
Great App..best discovery of the decade👌👌 Soo smooth and fluid operations..;
Stupid;
Good;
Everything is fair but we even can't change our threads username. It's same as the instagram. It uses all the instagram information that i don't like so. But 2 star for this app will be fine. I think so...;
While I post something then then app crashed .;
This app ui beautiful;
Chi nonsense app And u want to like him;
Good;
It good and easy to use 😌;
Please follow;
SUCH A POLITICAL APPLICATION META.;
Nice;
I downloaded a game about a button and the button game went off my phone faster. This is literally Twitter except empty because no one is using it yet so start a thread so this app can have text;
I know it's still messy. But, hopefully we can get a tl/nf thing where we can only see mutuals or threads we follow.;
It is very good ...... ........ ..;
RTL languages isn't supported properly unlike IOS. Text will always align as LTR whenever there is an English word, even if you started typing with an RTL language.;
Chaos on screen .. messages are overlapping to each other, unreadable.. bad bad apps.. still a billion mile away from twitter..;
Whitout instagram I can't login in this app It worst to use 🤬🤬;
Nice app monitaiiz Walla app sahiye;
Can not make a 1st time account, it just ask me to sign in using Instagram that I do not have on my phone, SO HOW TO MAKE A ACCOUNT?????;
The first few days it worked well until today. The app keeps shutting down & fails to open. Disappointed;
Very good and # add please;
Very nice and interesting our entertainment team.;
ချကြအားပေးနေမယ်;
Put translation button please.;
Good;
Threads login should be changed , it should be available for non Instagram users....;
Enjoying the thread based communication, however experienced lessened by frequent crashes;
Bad app;
Not having the ability to delete the account, this app is very dangerous and do not install it at all;
Best;
Very Use Ful Application;
Nic app it make friends with me and my friends are going to be fun;
It's crashed after i opened everytime.... Do Fix the bug..;
Dejenme quitar el número que ponen en el instagram;
Elon Musk is crying in corner;
Very good application;
Boring;
I can't download on my Kindle. 🙄 On my phone, yes, not my tablet.;
That's a very good app, very reliable and very easy to use, I highly recommend it;
This aap is so nice aap;
Really well made;
Not working this app;
Thread has a very unique design, just simple. I wish to have more fun with this app 😊;
Worst app;
Nice 👍🙂;
Good but they shd add more features to surpass Twitter. So I like to request Mark Zuckerberg & his team to pls add these features.👇 1. Should show no. of impression(views) in each post. 2. It should Show trending hashtags, # should work. 3. Theme should be impressive. 4. There should be inbox section to message privately. 5. It should show both followers & following on the profile. 6. There should be EDIT Button in every post. 7. Must add Poll section for voting. 8. Live Video should be there.;
BETTER THAN TWITTER TBH💀;
Good but should have a following and a dark mode.;
Amazing!;
Why you guys don't fix it's bugs when I first time downloaded it,it's login went good and then when I scroll it things are getting overlaped, I was not able to see a word , I deleted it and downloaded it again but the same problem occurs all the time , fix it as soon as possible;
Copied cat zukko for a Twitter app #ccopied cat;
No option fo create account. I don't use Instagram so they force to use Instagram.;
Amazing 😘😘;
This app is not working...when I start it...it shows the display glitch;
Display corrupt on my device, unreadable. Xiaomi note 5;
It is wonderful app to start with;
Good;
Good zuk rip elon;
So nice;
Mahi bhai ne bola toh karane kaa Mahi 👑 always love you msd Mahi miss you;
Stupid and unnecessary one. Just a rip off of Twitter.;
Oh 😱😱 amazing aap 😊😊😊;
Hate that I cant delete my threads account without also deleting my instagram account;
It's way better than Twitter!;
It's a better application for news and updates....good for students;
🙂;
Like most people are saying, the app is decent. It does need more features. You can't save photos or videos from your feed. It also needs a view media only mode. I believe that eventually everybody will migrate from Twitter over to this app, once the updates & new features come in.;
Same as twitter;
Simply will turn out to be the best in less than 1 month;
Elon Mask is my boss. He forced me to give 0 rating.;
The app is cool;
It's Two good for me;
I don't really see a purpose of this if you already have IG and Twitter. It's a complete bite of Twitter and just another step for Meta to dominate our data and lives.;
Good 👍😊🎉;
Nice interface, Hope doesn't change your mind in interface in other update .🙂;
"""Rusnya""";
Waooow;
My experience was worst I didn't even wanna give 1 star because whenever I open it there are so many glitchs and we click one thing but we see it's multiple selfs and it's running automatically;
Absolute rubbish, censorship worse thein in nazi Germany. Working to spread russian propaganda and if you post something from real world got banned not only from here but also on joined meta accounts.;
A download image feature would help massively also the search bar needs to improved to the users interests;
Copy for Twitter;
Follow me;
Nice;
Very bad app no like my photo Aadhar friend only celebrity increase account And Another user no boost account 😠😠😠;
I am facing some problems like, when I am trying to post something the app crashes 😐and it's happening again and again. Everything is fine as long as my network connection and mobile phone.. I don't get it what's the problem is..;
Lol, experiencing using this apps, and couldn’t getting code.;
mine glitches;
Kinda look like Twitter or maybe i'm wrong, and Threads has no advertisment so i think it's great anyway.;
Story dalne ka to do ismein;
Your app is good, almost perfect. We aldo need a place to chat with our followers like Instagram. Please we need it. Thanks Zukky;
Deletes instagram account also if someone wants yo delete threads account only;
am just addicted to that app, looking promissing and fancy!!;
I'm not able to deactivate my account. When I click on deactivate, I'm immediately logged out of my account. But the case is it's still visible to my friends and to check I tried to log in back immediately and my account was logged in which means that my account is not deactivated, if it was then I would not be able to log in back immediately. I request you kindly look into this matter and do something about this immediately. Also I faced the same issue with Instagram sadly.;
क्या बनेगा रे तू गुंडा.....;
- News feed too random, no meaning for follow my friends, random for what? - no hashtags system - can't using on PC but IG can (like need download app counts more than response user) - reduced video clip quality - cannot search for my media post from pass but twitter can - cannot draft the post - cannot change to the dark mode - no DM Good bye 👋;
This app is lagging on my phone. Please launch Lite version for low end device.;
👍🙂;
this is a very very bad application 👎🏻;
Love u markkk;
Twitter copy 😂😂;
I don't have a insta account...... so I couldn't login....;
Not a good app;
Soo dark. Also it's like an unlimited message just bombed on ur screen;
The app can be more interactive.;
This aapis very useful;
Verry nice;
Better twitter;
Abhi down pta ni Kaisa ho ga;
The best better than twitter.;
Twitter clone but a very basic one;
Worst . Twitter is Best .;
Im unable to use this app ,Im installing and deleting it for so many times but still whenever i open it there some glitche happening its have been more than 4/5 days i think still the glitch is happening;
Mark always copy cat;
Superb;
Bad and vary bad ok;
5 days in...leggy. @kingkia704;
Lgoodkd;
Its very simple and improved as soon as passible like live and story and others;
Cool app;
Bakwas;
Ok;
Why this app?;
Nothing in front of Twitter, Twitter is the best. I love twitter;
Needs improvement and speed.;
Impossible to use. It gets loaded with pics and text layered on each other infinite number of times and my whole screen turns into a mess. Guess it is not optimized or something. This is the only app that gives me such an issue, and Instagram itself works fine.;
love it and hate it so much at the same time coz we can't just go into gallery from threads suppose i wnat to pin a pic in someones thread i select pin and it just shows all pics from recent we have no option to select from gallery like in other apps we just have to keep scrolling 10000 of pics till we find the pic to pin in....plz let us open gallery our gallery from threads....its really annoying....;
good;
Good App ... 🤍🤍🤍;
Agar aapka Instagram account nahi hai to aap ismain log in nahi kar sakte. Pls iska solution karein kyu ki Instagram nahi chalata.;
please don't use threads app only use twitter;
Is good;
It has minimal UI and a typical user flow. There is a bug, though. When I try to upload images in the following thread, it shuts. I tried removing from recents, reinstalled, but stayed the same.;
🥱 another Zuckerberg data swiper;
Crash;
Accha hai;
Great app. Great potential. Great additions would be a following only feed & a DM system that's integrated with messenger & instagram DMs. A better followers & following system is also needed.;
Good;
😊;
This is a good app provide with fast information and have many more features then Twitter I am using Twitter for many years but it does not give any social media vibes;
I like this;
Good Application;
Copy pest zuck;
Not many data is present people just use it as a next gen Instagram that's only but Twitter have many database and easy to use very good features in Twitter threads is very very lack of data compared to twitter;
Copied app;
I'm satisfied😊;
VERY NICE APP;
Good;
Nice;
Good 👍😊;
Zuck need to stop forcing us to use this, let me delete the account without deleting my Instagram account;
This is the app I've been waiting for and I'm glad to come;
Worse app plz don't download.... If u login then u CAN NWVER DELETE UR ACC IN IT ... SUCH A NONSENSE APP;
Beautiful;
If you really want to learn something new, this app is for you. Instagram and Facebook is now full of chapri users.;

Nice to have in the phone;

Better than Twitter;
Amezing;
Not working, as soon i touch ut to scroll it a little, it washes the screen with words like when you scroll very fast and never stops just have to close the app then.;
Love what I see so far. I missed the Instagram craze when it first came out so I was very late to the game. I definitely think Threads will be the social media platform of the future. So I won't be late this time.;
Me rate this product but me no use this application because social media in Hilight this application.;
Very bad I install it 2 times but still glitch please fix the glitch screen bug;
Don't have built in dark mode and scroll is also to much laggy for me;
Nice app;
It's an imitation of Twitter. Too bad don't try it;
Okay app for now. It can be better of course, but time will show.;
I don't know but when I open the app it starts glitching.;
Good;
Much good;
It's glitching like hell, I can't even TRY the app, cause as soon as I open it it's just A COMPLETE GLITCH;

Very nice;
Threads the top and the other Photoshop;
Need more like downloading pics, dark mode, sharing post with other social media.;
Worst version of Twitter;
My application is bugging ,i don't know why Everytime i Scrolls down it get stuck like there is a graphic problem;
Too invasive! This isn't the 1st time #ThreadsApp has failed. It's been around since at least 2019 when it tried to rival #Snapchat & it failed miserably. #Zuckerberg is a joke who can't even come up w/his own original ideas. He just clones & steals others work! Can't wait till it fails again;
It's a good and interesting app but this app is child of Instagram 😂;
Magical;
Very good app;
Nice ago;
Malayaliyouda sotham traaaaaaa;
Twitter copycat;
It doesn't allow me to post free speech, Its sided with US democratic party. It's import to note Im not even from US and they force their woke content on me. Freedom of speech doesn't exist. Download Twitter ✌🏻 its real deal.;
When ever I open the aap everytime the app get crashed;
Jelek;
Cool;
When i want to upload photos, this app is automaticly closed. Solve this issue ASAP;
Bad app Can't open a new account on this app I recommend don't be install this worried app;

امیدوارم خیلی بهتر از این شود I hope it gets much better than that.;
Can't even post anything on this app I done know why;
Copy paste version of twitter 😆;
It's not working properly. When I try to scroll it starts glitching and I can't see anything.;
Terrible and buggy.;
Twitter better than threads;
Nice;
App has destroyed my battery life since installing, Samsung galaxy s22 ultra. Removed app, battery life is back to normal..;
A very bad app. It was created by copying Twitter exactly. Which no sane person can do.;
I cannot post photos with videos and cannot post single video or reply with videos. Always failed, please fix ASAP;
Good;
Wonderful app❤❤;
Much better;
Very easy to use better than twitter you can share with any one and you log in with your instagram you open the app and you see your account on instagram you click it and you just log in and when you open on you instagram profile you see threads picture and anumber behind it the number is your turn of installing threads easist and best app in 2023;
The app crashes too much, the screen appears unclear and irresponsive.;
awesome;
- Animations need improvements - need gifs in comments - can't save the picture from the feed;
Superb se Bhi upar;
1 star kasi laging nag g-glitch!! Kahilo accla;
Boring;
Very good app ever;
it seems fine really! but it keeps on lagging and the posts are overlapping whenever i start to scroll yeah it's fine. -fix it please;
COPY CAT! 乏善可陳, 綁定IG後要是刪除 會刪除IG!! 爛到爆炸 奉勸千萬不要成為meta抄襲別人的幫兇;

It's Is Not Good Very Bad This App.👎🏻❌;

My First Experience on Thread @. is 👍 G***;
Bawaal chij hai be , sara system hiljata hai 😍;
Story Upload Option Add Now;
Twitter copy 🤡🤡;
I love Threads App ❤️❤️;
so good;
Nice app . Firstly we actually needed replacement of Twitter and you guys did it perfectly , your growth proves this.;
I know development is still in works but i'm confident that i wouls not like to see suggestions in my feed/ Timeline. If the app must do this, i suggest there be a toggle button that actuall works to turn off suggestions. Other concerns arent as annoying.;
👍;
Very nice app;
Kuch to bat hai tumjhme;
Not a bad app it needs an update becoz whenever I upload video there is audio problem...automatically becomes muted ...u can also can't see live videos on threads ..only notification of live video is coming... Most important is there is login glitch... whenever I switched my accounts on instagram app ..the threads app also log out my account on threads app.. Every time I have to login my accounts on both apps..plz fix these glitches ..thanku;
the videos in my home page sometimes cannot be heard or they dont work correctly. im currently using s22. please fix it asap.;
All he did was ctrl c ctrl v;
I am not seeing how to message;
The most restrictive use app that i have ever seen in my life.;
Okey;
There is no Dm 🥺;
Alternative Of Twitter;
Um, so I have to install Instagram so I can create an account so I can log into Threads? Please fire your UX people...;
Nicest;
App is getting crashed while uploading the specific images.;

Perfect app 💯💯;
Overrated,no new features and missing old ones twitter has,not safe;
Still unstable;
Basically Facebook with a different UI. Let's see how long til bots take over this one too.;
This aap is not good / is aap ki vajh se mere insta id pe problam aai aur meri id ki post pr song show nhi ho rha plz is aap ko use na kre;
Better than twitter;
Good;
Trash Trash Trash!!! Let us delete this app! Holding us hostage by linking it to our Instagram page.;
I'm grateful that someone has created an alternative to the mess that Twitter has become, and Threads is looking promising. It's early days yet, so I expect changes, but the App desperately needs the ability to show Threads from people I subscribe to, and in chronological order of their posts. The interface is clear-ish but definitely needs work. No ads yet! Unfortunately, I've been followed by 'Sexy Susan' who has zero followers and a risque profile pic so I think the bots are active already.;
Poor;
Very bad;
good than twitter;
Perfect;
Not good then twitter;
So Good;

"A wonderful alternative to other search engines; much better in the realm of privacy and personalisation. Fully recommend to anyone looking for a more secure, honest, simple, user-friendly, and private browser - as well as anyone in general. The wide assortment of ad-blockers and add-ons are wonderful. Ever since switching I will never go back, and I'm very glad that I did. Google Chrome is awful in comparison. Seriously considered";
Nice 👍;
Faltu App. Use Twitter instead.;
Acha app hai;

Not too bad afterall.;
Very good 👍👍;
Very great copy 😂;
Cheap copy of Twitter and insecure it's take your data and use for different activities don't download this app;
Copy of twitter, zuck is cuck😭😃;
Twitter is still better😂😂😂;
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍;
Super;
Good app;
I don't want instagram.;
This app is very good and having a lot of fun after running it;
Worst experience 😭😔, i have installed threads just now and its being really like threads 😞, the app has some bugs to be fixed. As i opened the app i the posts weren't clear and were over lapping each other, creating a mess on my screen. It needs to be fixed as early as possible.;
Wah;
Not a fan, seemed decent at first but I don't want to be spammed with accounts I don't follow. They fixed the deactivate so it doesn't mess with IG, so that function works.;
Weird, It looks like a bad network on cable TV on my phone. I can't see anything. I'm wondering why.;
New;
I think it's cool;
Nice 👍;
There is no music on Button on videos...!!!!!!!!!!!!!;
Father of Twitter ☺️🤣;
Amazing app loved it ❤️❤️❤️;
just get twitter at this point bruv 💀;
it’s glitching;
क्या ही घटिया App है;
Fantastic;
Gud so far;
bro copied twitter..🤔😆;
there should be an option to download images like twitter;
Allow quick user account switching for multiple accounts, Hope to see a PC web version soon;
Mark zuku just fork the entire tweeter;
It's a good platform to share something privately or publicly 🌸 awesome work;
💯 Persent working;
Good app very interesting 🙄;
Good;
Okok;
Awesome;
Good;
Twitter is way better;
Audio get mute when video uploaded, so many features have to improve, so any features not working properly. Need much improvement. I must say that it's unsuccessful imitation of Twitter. Finally I say it's totally BAKWAS App.;
Twitter is 😭;
Encountered blurry display when scrolling looks the layer of the text and background overlapping;
Bekar hai , thu hai , jalla hai , guh hai 🤣;
Good app 👍;
Some post are failed to upload.;

Better than Twitter in different ways;
Okay;
Good one 😂;
Better than Twitter;
Nice;
Worst app👎👎👎;
Downloaded to try it and see if I wanted it. Hadn't realised I needed an Instagram account, which I don't have. I don't feel like selling soul to Zuckerberg today so I'm deleting.;
I installed this app, I thought that we can chat in this too like Instagram, but I could not find any chat option. There should be chat in this aap, I think you will get a difference from my review.;
Will not join threads because I am team Elon must!!!!!!;
Still early for this app, but I look forward for some cool updates;
Excellent;
Good;
the application looks nice from the outside and from the inside, but there are some hiccups you have in it, such as it doesn't have personal conversations, Twitter and Instagram And I searched for a theme in black when I find until now that it has another theme other than the white color and this does not suit people's thinking most of the time Dear Mark, Verify my personal account on Threads for free and you will be very grateful because I do not have the Enough money verify it by myself Thanks;
Good;
I Love Threads, it's better than Twitter.;
Stolen Twitter;
Average rating;
I think there something wrong thread app isn't properly working;
Nothing new, no uniqueness just like a clone of Twitter but a cheap version;
السلام علیکم;
Not working my threads;
I hate this app...but I hate Elon way more.;
Total copy of twitter there is no trending section or we cannot use hashtags, which means it is a Cheap Copy of TWITTER.;
It's awesome;
It's being crushing and crushing;
Amazing 😍;
Best Application than Twitter?;
My experience on threads app has even superb,I love it;
Clean, fast, straightforward. Everything that made Twitter fun before Elon;
Just Good.;
Nice;
Twitter with out the bigots;
App not working properly... overlapping texts;
Its a starting phase. Twitter users cant feel this;
Full copy of twitter;
Twitter is better than threads 😕 It is the same copy paste of twitter 🙃 Not bad Mark!;
Bad Apps ! Copying Mark Zuck is Noob Apps Best Apps For Twitter Elon Musk is My Favourite Pro Apps;
I don't use 👽 zuberg product;
This is fully bugs in open app I waste of my time and my expectations and net;
Very good and easy app for use.;
Buggy app, unusable.;
When are you going to add threads on Facebook social link, cause I want to let someone know it;
Isn't responding;
Best slap to elon tiny pp musk;
Killed Elon musk, 10 out of 10 just for that;
Mst axprense;
This app is good. But Twitter is best.;
Thies app is very interesting;
Nice 👍;
Not too different from insta, I'd stick to insta then. And it's not even that interesting;
Please don't install this application otherwise you will uninstall this then your Instagram also uninstalled;
Bad experience;
There's no direct message, can't see profile photos, can't search by keywords or hashtags, full of limit.. I hope you can improve base on what i wrote above.;
It keeps repainting it self on every action I perform to a point when nothing is visible anymore;
Bestttttttt;
unusable on tablet;
❤;
Really good experience, such a calm atmosphere , slightly boring - need a feature like reels - and a DM feature - and all the people we follow on Instagram to join!;
Best app;
Worst application in the history;
Nice Tal;
Ghanta jaisa app hai koi deshi app nikalo.. Har chig bedeshin hai. Lekin Russian🇷🇺 chor k 😅.;
"Great App! Loved it from the very first day although I have the following challenges; 1. My keyboard does not stack with the UI page, it covers it and so I can't see what I'm typing. 2. Can't save images like every other user. 3. From 100+, Can't see the latest follower as an individual to see their profile; have to search. 4. UI gets a little confusing sometimes as there's no proper demarcation between one thread on my timeline and another. 5. Opening some threads crashes the app occasionally.";
Just lost all the excitement of using this app...for last 24 hrs I can't load posts or comment on a threads. I tried reinstalling, clear cache nothing works. Best I can do is view and like that's it. So frustrating;
Great app;
this could have been a feature on IG instead bruv.;
Please add translate feature also;
Tati app;
Good;
Use less 😒😒;
NEEDS A DRAFT FEATURE;
The app keeps crashing;
Useless;
Lnd aapp;
Very nice 👌;
Please make an option to only show my followers on my timelines;
I Loved This App. This App Very Similar To Twitter App. So Mark Zuckerberg Great Invent To This App. Love You Mark Zuckerberg Mama👍;
Worst app, cheap copy of Twitter & also I can't delete my account;
Should include dark mode;
Don't make it another Instagram, ban videos, limit pictures, let it be about writings and stuff.;
Bakwas app;
The time I'm spending in the app is unbelievable, love it so much🩵;
Best;
I expected this app made by Meta as a competitor to Twitter be well thought out and mostly finished. Nope, it's like a modern video game release. Release a cobbled together alpha stage product and then make it usable after months or years. There should be a feed that only shows your subscriptions but nope, there's one feed and it shows everyone and you can't filter out content you don't like. I was constantly being flooded with sports, rappers, and christians... absolutely disgusting.;
Best;
Good than others;
It's glitching the f out man! Like it's not even opening properly!! Wth;
Good job really good app 👍;
Good;
It's new, give it a chance! This is everything Twitter isn't and I'm so good with that! They are still making tweeks to the system but the best part is, there are no fascists!!;
Pretty streamlined.;
It's a very lively and user friendly app but I think the UI need an upgrade and also if possible u will be able to know people you are following that ain't following back;
A cheap copy of twitter;
Useless app;
Love the concept of the app but I can't post anything without the app closing down! Very frustrating!;
Worst app deleting this also delete Instagram 😭😤;
Nice app;
Do NOT download this app. This is bloatware and once you go to uninstall it, you will have to delete your Instagram account as well. Basically, it's a trap created by Mark Zuckerberg.;
ممتازه;
Not entertainment this app.. Not story's not like & retweet cound exr....;
ممتاز;
Got app but it kept closing and refused me to set up an account no mater what I tried the app flagged me and that made no sense! I found another way and off I was made one post will wait and see if it gets noticed. As far as Facebook I don't use it much but probably more than I with threads will wait and see if they actually flag me for my one post ? Surprise surprise I finally decided to do a thread post and bam it never posted I didn't like Facebook much hate Twitter being run by Elon Musk.;
Useless;
Baaaad;
Rs;
nice;
Not deserving even 1 star. Worst experience.;
There is no trending option for knowing latest trending things;
Good;
Only good thing is, it is free. Nothing new.;
Great news feed. I hate Twitter. Thank you for a great alternative;
Really loving the app so far, but there is a serious issue with watching video clips where when I click the unmute audio button the video will just stop playing and freeze frame.;
It's not good It's like fully shaking Please check mine and clear it for mee;
Ok;
As soon I opened the Application, it started acting like weird.;
Worst app ever👎🏻;
Hello World..Hello sir, I have just downloaded this app and I don't know how it works.;
Please add dark mode to it;
Op;
I think it’s not bad.🙂;
Super;
Is this app crash in my phone;
Better experience but.;
It is an app only to steal data, it is useless and when deleting the account it only deactivates it but the number continues to appear on the instagram profile;
This app seriously needs a FYP and hashtags, getting sick of only seeing posts of people I follow;
Nice;
Follow me;
Got more bugs than a termite infested building;
Forces you to use Instagram;
i like;
Good apk among all social media🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟;
Its so bad when you force your users to delete thier instagram account if they want to delete their threads account!!!;
I love this app;
Why i can't add two accounts in one device?;
Very basic. Third rate Twitter knock off. Just get Twitter.;
I think this is good app;
West this app boring boring 😭;
lol Copy and pasted;
Useless app if we try to delete thread account, it will also delete our Instagram account as well and it pathetic and useless;
Good;
👍👍👍👍;
App is crashing;
So far so good.;
Nice 👍;
There's a glitch in the app. Pages are overlapping. Tries every possible aspect to resolve the issue by re-installing, clearing cache & data but still unable to use the application properly. Very disappointing. Finally, uninstalled the application as for now. Whenever the app will improve, will download it again. Till then using that old Twitter.;
hello sir this app so very good support my account ❤️;
Not bad .quite good;
The application needs a lot of updates. Also, it is bad. When deleting the account, it deletes the Instagram account with it. I hope to amend and thank you;
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮;
There is limitation for writing threads i hope you guys will make it.anyways good app for everyone.;

Khup chan aap aahe Instagram la follow like khup vahdtat;
It has so many bugs pls fix them;
User friendly;
Sup✨️;
So far so good. Add more features and it will be the best.;
Not worth it;
Can't delete the account! seriously;
Very much satisfied with this app;
Bug issues in photos upload;
Overlapping issues! Fix it;
Good;
Overall, it's fine for a quick social media fix. No curation though. One thing that's weird is that at least for me, on Android, there is no chat or DM feature of any kind. Kinda weird for an app named after the late IG messenger app...;
Too Lag...;
Please add a switch account feature. Also, save images and download videos;
Kuch khaas mhi hak;
I have a bug where i cant use the app beacuse the text is doubled and when i try to scroll it keeps multiplying and i cant read anything and cant use the app;
Cheap knockoff;
أريد تحميل الفيديوهات في قناتي لكن تطبيف ثندر هذا ثقيل جدا و هذا تطبيق جديد يحتاج لصيانة لأنه يبطئ الهاتف و الويفي و ينشر أخبار تافهة و منشورات غير منظمة;
Nice 👍👍;
It's the mostly good;
When messages and hashtags are available, you will get the rest of the stars;
Just wow;
Good so far. Hoping they keep the vileness of the blue check app away.;
تطبيق ممل;
Way too much data is collected, a dak zebi d zuck jm3 kerk;
Very useless app;

Good potential and nice to not have to constantly be reminded of elons existence, albeit the app is still pretty new so there's still some features in the works but overall I see the potential;
Copy paste Twitter 😂😂;

I like this app🌼😘;
Very good Aap;
Zuck sucks. Go Elon;
Loved me two days tomorrow and;
Really great app almost like Twitter but it's good.hope some new features occure.;
Good work;
Superb solution;
Kya Ghatiya app hai koi reply nahi karti;
Good;
Basically just shows a bunch of brands social media managers trying to be quirky. Too much time spent using the mute button to not even curate a desired feed.;
Looks like notepad;
Love it;
The app keeps refreshing itself😡😡😡, There's no translation option, that sucks;
Good 👍👍👍👍;
I don't like it Copy;
Good;
it's best;
Copy of Twitter?;
No option for turning off video auto play👎 consume too much mobile data.;
Not better than Twitter...;
It'so cool app;
There are no messages in the application, and also if someone deletes an account, they delete Instagram;
Thread 👍 Twitter 👎;
How to download or use this application in laptop?;
It's just a good vibe;
Can't have a threads without having an Instagram? Boo. I just wanted a Twitter alternative not an insta account. Uninstall.;
Itzz lagging;
Put an edit button please!;
Good,but when I say that Twitter is better than threads my threads acc got banned.🤣🤣👍👍👍;

Great support positive people;
Nyc App;

Great app.;
All these paid reviews made me rolling on floor laughing 😂;
This is a good app and nice competition to it has very good potential to grow;
Im very much enjoying it's experience, but it should have a lot more better features.;
Bundling with Instagram is very annoying.;
I can't use this app properly. It's have a lot's of lagging. When i login threads, my account logout automatically and it stopped running. Why??? If it's possible i wanna show some screenshots of laggings of this apps.;
Nice 👍;
It's a good idea, but completely useless at present. What's the point of following people if my feed is flooded with people I don't follow?;
I like this app very much...but last night it kicked me out. Everything I try to get back in, it does it again...its frustrating and I don't know if its ever going to let me in.;
How to verify threads?;
Please add dislike option............;
😊;
Great app... but some things need fixing. The app crashes anytime I try to upload a photo, probably 10mb or higher. Plus, the quite disorganised feed. Asides that great app and competition for Twitter;
"I really like that there are no white supremacists or scammers pretending to be other people with the blessing of the owner of the app. Definitely a place without a flood of misinformation and lies portrayed as fact and allowed under the guise of ""freeze peach""...";

This is not running in my mobile. This app also glitching, every time I scroll.;
Great app;
❤️;
It's more like Facebook, in my opinion, but it doesn't allow for hashtags or topic searches. I prefer Twitter, most def. I want to delete it, but the app does not allow account deletion without also deleting my Instagram. Not happy with the app at all, really.;
Excitlent;
Add Trending option and hashtags option. Please update logo like what's show in app logo in colour and logo in colour is better than Balck and white. Please update logo and update app;
@tti.trends 🙌 FB;
¿Porque ponen a gente a la que no sigo en el feed?;
Threads keeps shutting down as soon as I open it. I will rate it when the glitch is fixed. Just showed update, but after updating it still crashes.;
"App is Good But Thread App need More improvement like Missing ""Thred Inbox"" or save photos or videos or varification request please fix all problems of this app !";
Eu quero apagar;

Well I downloaded the app only to find out afterwards that you have to have a Instagram account to log in, and there's no other way around that that I saw, so 1 star. If it's fixed, then I will re-review. I don't have Instagram and I'm not getting it either.;
So good 👍;
We Want Direct Message Option and Hastag Option;
😔;
I don't like this app because it is so careless 😪;
The app is not fully optimised, if you go to upload a photo or video then it will crashed.;
Mast;
Wants too much personal information. Suspicious 🤨;
Stop selling my personal data to third parties;
Elon Musk twitter is better;

Twitter nahin Bana paoge meta 😂😂😂😂;
While scrolling the page all the pages are ovearloaded I can't use the app properly it makes bad impression on the app;
Better Than Twitter Honestly;
Not good at all;
Very bad... Many screens open in one screen;
It's awesome.;
ILove this app ✌️🙌💫🤘;
I'm from Bangladesh. I like 🤩;

It's the worst than Twitter;
Showing much glitches ..and letters, sentences, words are collapsing with each other.. tried to reinstall it several times ...but still the same result... Fix it soon..;
They should add trending feature;

A very good social site;
Awesome app 💯;

Too many random people in my feed, can't find content from the people I follow;
Nice but can't dm;
Twitter is better;
No information from the developer.;
Bad;
Splendid 💯;
kiya baat hai , mast hai mast👌;
Excellent;
Nice 👍👍😊;
So boring and randomly;
No response to my threads post .I post daily on thread but not recommending my post to anyone on thread. Not recommended 🤬;
There is a lack of Messenger in this, if the messenger was in it, it would have been better. It would have been a very good app, but if there was a messenger, I would have given five stars. That's it for now.;
Good;
Nice app;
Need more improvements add more features make it app as user friendly Please avoid collecting personal datas from users add more security features;
Best;
Bad;
Much better than Twitter;
Super 👌;
So far, so good.I like the layout and ease of use;
Complicated interface, not interested in this app, very booring, there should be improvement in user interface, it's far worse than Twitter or Instagram;
Gf Banegi to 5 Star duga🤫;
Just a copy of twitter and a ruiner of instagram;
Vah;
Cool;
Good aap;
It's ok but cannot download videos or images like I can on Instagram or twitter and Facebook, maybe some one will get around to writing on or just use the Instagram's downloader.;
I think some of yall just need a new phone ☠️;
Very bad experienve;
Why is it not advertised letting us know that we can't delete this app unless we delete Instagram?? Posting with 5 stars to push to the top;
worst than twitter;
tryna be twitter;
Awesome so far.;
Very good 👍;
This is just a simplified Facebook. Nothing else. No chronological order sorting and no way to filter only those who you follow. I'll just stick to Twitter until y'all decide to give users what you want.;
Good;
There is still room for improvement to meet expectations...;
Instagram hack ho jata hai yarr mat chalayo😡😡😡;
Good;
Twitter is best;
First of all ,this app simply easy to use, by all means can u guys make an update about adding some translation words ,thanks...;
Great app. I love the change of social media space... I just hope the install and update options are improving.;
I need have two threads account at the same time but I can't;
Im using android 9 on color os and its overlaying everything. If i scroll it turns into a mushy text biriyani. Currently it is absolutely unusable. PLEASE FIX IT OR LET US HAVE A SITE FOR PC Edit: they fixed the issue;
Stupid login;
Copy From Twitter, Not Good Fake Application 😠;
Good;
You should give a chat section as well so if someone wants to talk then he can. And if you say that we can chat on Instagram, that is a different thing but I strongly advise to add a chat section.;
Half baked, algorithm is nonsense, no easy way to view content you actually want to see.. It's being hyped as a Twitter killer but it's just not good at all. It's just a more ad heavy, fake, brand sensitive version of Twitter.;
I don't like Elon Musk(🐒);
This app has a lot of potential and there's definitely some room for improvement. I just wish on the next update they would add the dark mode thingie;
The app is good, but the app is unnecessary. With a/an Facebook/Instagram/Twitter previously in use, I find minimal usage for a [new] version of the same apps. Also... you will delete your personal IG account when you delete Threads, which is not only redundant, but a directly violation of my intellectual rights, and there is no NDA, MOU/MOA, or any other contractual agreements within the terms and agreements, prior to you logging in, and/or your account being pre-setup by the [app], itself.;
After 6 days use, it's not good so far. After all that noise, Twitter still better.;
Pics quality is very low in new update which yesterday update;
Don't feel it;
Lovleee 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼;
Hello sir. Outstanding amount app thanks and please slove my account all problems.;
So amazing;
Excellent 👍👌;
I have downloaded this app Due to our leader Imran Khan Love you 😘😘;
Hot trash tbh. Why am I not allowed to see only the people that I'm following? Why can't I download any media?;
Komal ❤️👈;
This app not for intermediate;
Just Facebook with Twitter UI and with the poor Facebook algorithm which showes you the least intrested posts for you;
better than twitter;
The thread app is good app as I heard from my friends.but when I installed and opened the app,it's is something coming like it's having a bug on that.i think meta can rectify that types of errors and not only for me,i saw many of the review that they are also having some bug while opening it, hence meta want to rectify as soon as possible.;

Welcome to yet another South Park real life analog for choosing between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. Do you want Twitter or Threads? Elon or Mark? Either way, you get a guy who cares about your personal data more than your life.;
Too many post that I don't follow;
The rest of the age will come to know experiment when it is necessary to be more and different even if all looked same yes (feature) could have been introduced in some new form. But he was not kept equal to his rival. It is expected that more good things will be seen in the future.;
Op world;
Rip off of Twitter. Like Twitter but it steals all your data.;
I don't want to use both Twitter and Instagram in same app it sucks..🤣😆;
Easy to use;

Don't have Instagram, don't want Instagram, I'm not installing Instagram to get this app. Sticking with Twitter.;
Every time I want to post something, this app closes on my face and I have to restart typing again, so annoying;
This is an application adapted from Twitter and it is not safe and I do not recommend it at all;
It actually deserves all appreciation and respect, Although it's in need for some improvement but it works far so good.. The issue I'm facing now is that I can't publish or write any post, as whenever I try to post something, the app constantly stops working... So plz fix these issues to make ur social platform more convenient and reliable💙 Thxxxxxx;
It's not good;
Excellent👍;
SSuuppeerr;
Super;
😔;
I can't found what I want in the search;
I just downloaded this to say I'm not using this. People need to realize Zuckerberg's companies have violated many ethical standards.;
1)When I like something, nothing happens, tye command isn't taken (2)Not smooth at all (3)The colours are dead, make it more interesting and wholesome (4)When I try to Reload a page by swiping down, the symbol keeps on doing the reloading animations over and over again, but the page doesn't change (5) Having trouble using more than one account, like insta. If the option is not there to use multiple accounts, this app is dead;
Worst ever;
Best;
I need the daark mode settings asap;
It would nice to be able to copy memes to my phone.;
Banyak bgt bugnya;
Working Great 👍;
"I'm failing to install this app on my phone despite it being compatible with my device. It downloads 98% but then crashes and I get the message ""cannot install threads "" 🤷🏾‍♂️";
I love this app keep going ! Much better than twitter !!;
You need website, i cant use in PC...;
Very poor nothing new on it still Twiter much better and far away from this app.. I think there must be a new and smart concept to attract users.;
Please make it using without Instagram, I don't have any Instagram account but I really love to use threads 🥲💔;
Hgf;
Just ok.;
this app litterary cracks and shakes like my screen has got issues but it doesn't if it did i would not be commenting on this app peacefully pls can this issue be fixed;
Firstly, I want to express my appreciation for the overall concept of Threads. It provides a convenient and private platform for sharing updates, photos, and videos with close friends. However, the integration of the Reels feature within the app has caused some inconvenience and cluttered the user experience.Separating the Reels section within the app would greatly enhance the user experience. It would allow for improved focus, easier navigation, enhanced privacy, and a streamlined interface;
There is no option to delete your account unless you delete Instagram It's privacy nightmare the app collect everything all my data on my phone I don't feel safe and there is nothing I can do about it It was trap for me to download this app and i fall in it;
Nice apps;
Okey 👌🏻;
Cool;
Ugly and looks like a beginner designer who works on this;
I like ❤️;
I don't understand why the hell they need another app;
kürek;
Who needs twitter;
Plain and boring app. Sticking to Instagram for now.;
Nice app;
Terrible app. Doesn't let you delete, and doesn't let you hide the badge on Instagram either. What a cheap trick.;
it's Good;
One bad thing is that you can't delete your user account, if you do, your Instagram account will be deleted too And I hope that this problem will be solved in new updates;
Pakistan ❤;
Can't sign up;
I like Instagram Twitter is bad apps;
So good this app is more affordable to use;
Installed it to see what the fuss was. Could not create an account - must have existing Instagram account. I don't use Instagram. Uninstalled. Shortest installed app ever.;
Cant find the dark mode option its hurting my eyes;
NO BODY will see your posts if you haven't any followers on instagram already! Totally useless. I'm unistaling this.;
A copy;
Lota fun;
Good use it 👍;
No private chat... That's so bad I guess;
Super fun, easy to use UI!;
Excellent;
Just delete Twitter and go with Threads.;
Wanna be twitter. Trying too hard to be both;
Copy cat;
Mast he ye app;
The application is very good, it is very good compared to the twitter , it is a lot of fun to use;
sucks;

Useless application also i uninstalled Instagram so much hate is spreading on lord ram and hinduism even after reporting the comments and video not action is taken.;
Want to see what its all about but app keeps force closing when I'm typing something for some reason?!;
Great social network. I'm missing a few twitter features, but hopefully they will come in the future. For now, it's just great.;
Threads is one of the few app I can recommend everyone to use;
Useless app.. It's just terrible clone of Twitter;
Its good but why the fvcks the feed not movin?;
"Everything seemed fine, some little glitches when needing to verify my account but the problem started when I went back onto Instagram and couldn't access my homepage as it was replaced with a while screen saying ""Welcome to Instagram. Follow some accounts"" while giving me suggested accounts, treating me like a new account. I've deleted both apps multiple times and restated my phone, worked for a little but now back to how I mentioned. A real pain, I've sent complaints but nothing yet.";
I don't normally write reviews but I'm so annoyed with this app! I've tried to share a picture about 10 times, both by sharing from my gallery and directly uploading to the app and it's not working. I've tried updating the app and when that didn't work, uninstalling and reinstalling. I'm at a loss. Very frustrating.;
Random people appears on my HOME. Seriously?;
Ngl this app is a lot more addicting. I've never used Twitter but this is way better;
Why do I have to make an Instagram account just to use this app?!;
Needs some tweaks but it's way more acceptable than that mess Elon made of Twitter.;
One needs an Instagram account - Buuuuuhhhh.;
Thank you for invading our privacy 👎👎👎 Hey viewer try checking which kind of data Threads is collecting before installing... I am sure you'll hate it immediately.;
An impressive piece of Spyware that's good at circumventing firewalls. Another app you'll want a separate phone for. Aggregate accounts and corporate shills are what ruined Instagram as a platform, and Threads is a celebration of those things. A great app for stalkers and law enforcement in states where abortion and being gay or trans is illegal.;
🌺🙏🌺;
There is no point in using this app, Not good for getting valid news, Not good for entertainment ... Twitter is way better;
an extremely bland rip-off of twitter. there's a lacking of something but i can't quite pinpoint what it is;
Very excellent;
Great app, was never on Twitter but Threads has me hooked;
So much good;
Meh;
I genuinely like the Threads app. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of some features i feel the app needs. Trending topics should have been there from the premiere. Also DMs, even if it's a button that links us to Instagram DM to complete the conversation. The app could also use the Spaces function. Overall, Threads is amazing.;
Worse;
this app is really bad the ui is not user friendly I couldn't understand anything;
You stole this app;
Easy to use and responsive. Loved the interface;
It's good 👍🏼;
This app is copy by Twitter;
Okay so far needs to fix some issues. I'm sure they are already hearing about all of the features that are missing but I'm actually having issues with gif uploads. When I upload a gif it glitches bad, turns it green and purple with 4 overlays of the same gif;
It is a very good app;
The app is good but i think there should be an option for pinning threads on a person's profile and also the time that feed takes to load is slow;
Nice app 👍👍;
Not what I expected.. with that being said I was informed if I delete the app my Instagram gets deleted as well. Why would you do that.. not a fan of it, it's complicated if you ask me. Disappointing;
Why theres no threads listed in social links platform in facebook? I suggest you include threads so that you can share your threads acc link in your timeline. Thank you.;
Not bad. It's a hybrid of Instagram and Twitter. So far so good, interested to see the reputation this app builds.;
Censorship is the name of the game.;
The app, I think, is cool. It still needs work. I wish when you're about to post a picture there was a way to choose what gallery album to go into. It gets annoying having to scroll through all my pictures to find what I need.;
I think it's just a copy of Twitter I thought it's gonna be special and better but it's worse actually.;
Nice New social media app. I'm really loving this.;
Unable to create an account;
This has potential. Still needs some updates to make it usable fulltime. Needs: -Following only feed in chronological order -Start feed where you last read, current feed jumps to top -Allow third party apps access Do that and I'm done with Twitter forever;
Clean experience;
Fascinating app;
I really like it! Easy to use. Converts instagram following & followers instantly too.;
it works;
App is bugged can't see anything;
Woh;
No save button;
the worst I don't like it at all;
Terrible;
Good;
Meta👎;
ریدم به قبر پدرت زاکر گوزو;
👍🏻;
i did not like it at all;
Its twitter bro dont use this app ita just for wasting time;
I was really enjoying Threads until today, yes it definitely needs work with the feed and following but over time that will improve I'm sure. However, as of an hour ago, everytime I try to reply to a thread, it crashes as soon as I type the first letter? Hope you fix this ASAP! I really don't want to go back to Twitter! 😭 Update! Started working again after I posted this review! 🤣 Fingers crossed it keeps that way ☺ Further update! Same stupid crashing issue when trying to reply, grrr 😡;
App like giving bamboo behind Twitter;
A) we need a character count B) we need hashtags to actually work C) we need to be able to pin a post to the top of our profile. D) we need to be able to save media. Everyone shares and saves media. Wtheck. E) also we can't mute accounts? Sorry but I don't wanna block every single person out there. I use this for one thing and one thing only. And because it's new there are THOUSANDS of ppl idk showing up on my feed. Sorry but this won't ever replace twitter. 🤣🤣;
Wow this app is the best.everybody feels related,it's such a close community.just wish it had more features.;
Best👍👍👍;
F Elon honestly lol;
Facebook, ew;
Very nice so much;
Clean UI;
Keep respect Twitter;
Wow;
Thanks Meta 🔥🔥🔥;
Nothing new for obviously reasons. It's missed a big feature from the other: anonymity. People liked the other cause they could be someone else, a fun username and share random thoughts, far from real life people, so... Some people said that if your ig is on dark mode, than threads will also be. My ig is on dark mode and yet threads is on light. Would be better if this setting was a part, just add dark mode button on threads.Also you can't delete the account unless you delete your ig account.;
The app works well and I like it so far, but it's missing a few things, like a section for my liked post or bookmarks so I can revisit them. Don't know why they were left out since IG already has them.;
Nice;
It is a great site for keeping up with the latest news from top journalists. Also, it is not a cesspool of white supremacy and hate as opposed to the dying bird site.;
For a new app it's great. But, it lacks dark mode which I and several people want/need. I know that they will be adding it, but the home page doesn't show who I'm following half the time and instead is showing other people I have little to no interest in. As well as this, the lack of tags seems to be a problem if it's not added soon. Other then that, a very good start and already better then Twitter.;
Not good.;
Excellent;
T&C's are outrageous! My gender, sexual orientation, and my browsing history?;
Seems much better!;
No ads (yet).;
my app is crashing, always shaging when i try to scroll the app, i think it is a bug. will change my rating when already fixed;
Good application;
👌👌👌👌👌👌;
🙏🙏;
Good Experience For Threads... Well done 👍✅;
Good, aap is better than Twitter absolutely easy to use no problem in login 🙂 just awesome 🥰;
Horrible Twitter Knockoff;
Excellent;
Good app;
Cut and paste from Twitter, nothing new, we need fresh ideas;
The user experience so far so good, clean and neat, and easy to navigate through, my biggest problem with it, that there's no Dark Mode so far, and the people following you can easily find and follow you back, which is a thing that I should choose instead of the system choosing it for me, I acknowledge it's an Instagram App, but when it to comes to the user choice, it's better to let the following stuff up the users themselves, not automatically you find the same list migrating to threads..;
💩;
Super this is very useful for Instagram and secure safety🤞👏👏👏;
Very good app;
Amazing app;
Wrost;
Bit buggy on android 9 device, after reloading threads layout seems overlaping each other;
Good app . However on thing we request is to have the translation there. Not all of us read a particular language . If have I will change mine to at least a four star for now;
New and the best app..;
Good app;
Easy to use, better than Twitter;
App logout ing everytime;
Copy of Twitter and tracks twice the personal information;
Almost two hours of background usage on a day I used this app at most 5 minutes, same happens frequently with Facebook and Instagram so I end up switching the to Restricted Background Usage... Meta data collection is really intensive apparently.;
Always bugs, log out many time.;
There is nothing new. Everything is copy of Twitter. This is not fair.;
Better than Twitter for the most part. Need a chronological following only feed.;
nice;
Bad;
It's Really useless👀;
I DON'T have an INSTAGRAM account. Finding difficult to login.;
Good;
Love;
What a great app threads.....!!! Let's join!!!;
Good better than twitter;
Amazing app;
🔥🔥🔥❤❤🔥;
I do hope they could add translator to fans that are international, hard to read some threads that aren't the same language that I use :')) But overall, the app is good :));
Awesome and worth supporting;
It's refreshing to be somewhere not [insert rival app here], but the app needs work: 1) Chrono order timeline (seeing the same non-followed accounts is boring). 2) In addition, if you want to stick w/ the current timeline (For You), fine, but give us a Following timeline as well. 3) For brands/social media managers that work on multiple accounts, please implement an easier way to switch accounts than having to log out then log in (it gets annoying). 4) Please add a way to schedule posts. Thanks!;
very good app;
Best;
Nice;
I have never used Twitter so I can't compare but man it is annoying that 90% of my thread is full of stuff I didn't ask to see.;
Good products;
Ugly;
Its quite a good app for me and hope i gain more followers and like lol;
Good;
Amazing;
Yeh not bad ezyly can use;
बहुत अच्छा है आने वाले समय में यह ऐप ट्यूटर को पीछे छोड़ सकता है;
Why can't we delete it😒;
👉Bio for Threads/Threads Bio ideas: Hey there, fam! Have you heard about the Threads app?  It’s Instagram’s super cool text-based conversation app that’s all the rage right now! Get ready to take your chatting game to the next level with this application. Instagram, is the greatest platform where billions of individuals from all corners of the globe come together to connect, share, and inspire through attracting photos and videos.  Threads!  is like Instagram but for text! Can you believe it?🥰;
Nice;
Better than twitter👍;
When i downloaded this app not even 5 min of having it i got hacked 👎;
Apps keep stopping;
Super;
No way to just follow friends. Sooooo much spam;
Best;
Seriously Not Verified me;
Good.;
Very bad app Please solve account deleting problem;
Very bad application;
Besia r aa Dsmak;
Not a lesser of two evils, just a different evil.;
Kinda bad compared to twitter;
Hey Creator, Is there any problem with threads it's not running in my phone! The homepage of thread buffers and all the texts, posts etc overlap each other. I have tried all the possible things like reinstalling, rebooting my phone, etc. Please try to fix the bugs. Thank you!!;
Pues quiero eliminar la cuenta y no quiero eliminar mi Instagram. Pero lo haré si es necesario.;
We did not need a new time wasting app;
After reading the data usage I decline to even open this!!;
Nice;
It's new but i'm already glued;
Good but i am Og fan of Twitter;
Nice one;
Threads > 🐦;
I dont know why, but i could imagine your logo to be rainbow line (matching instagram) on black instead of white line on black background.. but white on black is pretty too☺️;
Not working while uploading images.;
Breath of fresh Air! I never knew just HOW toxic the other app had gotten until I switched to Threads. It's only been a week and everyday it gets better and better.;
Plzz don't dwnld the app;
""" Most Excellent App By Threads """;
Faaltu;
Why its connected with Instagram.. i installed it and open account from insta. Now this thread badge is shown up in insta's bio. I Removed it many times from there..but its again shown on page refresh. Please do this app independently from insta...or i uninstall both the app..🙂;
Love;
Congratulations 👏🎉;
Have to have an Instagram for it, it's not a separate thing.;
This is batter than Twitter;
Please know that if u download this app once and link it with ur insta then cant delete it id u delete ur insta id will also be permanently deleted;
I love this app ❤❤;
Usefull App;
Thik h;
The only thing I don't like so far is the fact that we can see people we do follow reply to people we don't and theirs no option to turn it off;
Good;
Why do I have everything on my feed here? Content and pages I don't even follow? How do I control what I don't like and want on my feed?;
VR;
Like it;
Good app nice and smooth ui;
Very well;
Good;
Very generic. You also can't delete without deleting your Instagram account. Privacy concerns.;
Instagram account holder only login thread why;
Good;
Sucks! Scumbag version of Twitter.;
😵👎;
Excellent;
Good 👍;
❤️❤️;
😙😙😙😙;
Can you please add the ability to save photos and videos;
Well this app will leak your identity because threads is trying took our data.. This app is pretty Scary and took our private information and search history.. its creepy;
I found a error occurred in download the app, it was downloaded till 97% then it is not continues. What can I do;
❤❤❤;
The videos stop playing once I unmute the sound. I'm not sure why but other than that, it's a cool app I guess.;
Ek no.;
This app has nice logo;
Very very usefull app🥰;
a fantastic app;
All I see is random posts curated by Algorithms... I would really appreciate an option just to stick to the posts of the people I follow. Otherwise, why bother with follow button, it's taking forever to locate their posts.;
😴😴😴😴 i can't understand what is this😒😒😒😒;
Nice;
Would rate 0 stars, insane to not disclose that this will become permanently attached to your Instagram account. Wish I'd never downloaded.;
Nobody asked for this;
i love threads ✨🖤;
Super;
i love it sm, please make this app a safe place. Also,please include making following 'private' and feeds for 'following' only and not from strangers.;
AWESOME APP;
Not bad for an initial launch. Looking forward to future versions, and hopefully a web interface that allows posting. Needs a lot of work, but will probably exceed Twitter's features and eventually popularity.;
Installed to check it out, saw there was no way to filter by people you follow (seriously, that's a pretty basic feature). Super bare bones imo and really no different from Twitter and that includes the toxicity. I stick with Mastodon and the fediverse.;
This is a best app;
This app was very interested app use the Twitter app;
The best Social Platform;
Omg this app needs so many permissions to run. Scary;
This is likely the most overhyped program in the history of forever. The news feed desperately needs filters and there's just not a lot of organization or structure to it. It's basically just a reformatted version of Facebook.;
App got an update and fixed everything.;
Not download search YouTube 🤦🤦;
Very good for social;
App looks good but it's unfinished.I can't download pics no # . Like button should be on right or at least can change left or right . Meta just rush it out cuz they wanna be the first to rival with Twitter.Still need a lot to do and I don't think this will beat Twitter cuz main reason people use Twitter is because nsfw content.Thread should at least allow nsfw content and give user whether they wanna hide it or not.Its not that difficult,other social media app have it.;
I hope this app Twitter Copy. And instagram and Twitter mixing ... I hope batter;
One of the best app;
Worst experience;
Good;
nice app but it need to add save post option and add save pictures to galary or download it;
not good;
Trash, I got to have an Instagram? I never used that pedophile trash app!;
They shouldn't have made it so difficult.;
I wish translation option be available soon;
great app;
Verry fun;
data theif zuck .;
Twitter ki gali;
Not interested;
🥰;
Super threads;
Poor;
Good app🐸;
Hi dear how earn money dollor pls help me not idea earning send photo tricks thanks you;
Achcha nahi Kara app delete Karo ga to Instagram se Id delete ho jaye gii;
Its a good apk i love this apk;
Delete system;
Gatiya Time Waste not Good;
When you open your thread number on your Instagram you can't get it back so they need to fix that;

Absolutely amazing apps thread very useful batter then Twitter ☺️;
Awesome;
Cheap Twitter;
Incredible 😍;
mediocre on tablets • can't view it in landscape, • no 3-dot menu for settings, • no symbols allowed for user name's ie. hyphens, • doesn't support split-screen mode, • can't multi link to other apps (Instagram lets you crosspost to Twitter), • no link to connect with the DEV's how about GitHub or Gitlab or ??? • not available for Huawei AppGallery (requires Google Play Service) due to an US anti-China policy.;
it was good at first but as long as you use it often, it suspends both your Instagram and threads account;
Nothing productive just celebraties posting their story waste of time, Twitter is far better;
very slow and hanging always. could have been better. but having intial launch app it should be better launch with mote adoption and smooth. and not hanging. already disappointed .;
No way to turn off auto play;
Instagram account required is bad news.;
Perfect app;
Good app;
不能下载里面的图片和影片很可惜;
Nice 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍;

It's like Twitter but it have many more options for privacy;
💪💪;
As like Twitter 😇;
I LOVE THIS APP 🫶🏻✨;
Nic plateform;
Threads is awesome 👍;
Installed expecting something new, but I don't find so.;
i give 1 star. this app is good but dont give the option to just see the Threads only from the people we follow ! why must i read from strangers ?? enough with the random strangers rant in our feed ! and there's no translation service. good thing is it filters out p0rn unlike shwitter.;
Gujjn;
"Worst copy ever by zuck Twitter>>>>Thrads Zuck suck Zuck-""we will copy every social media platforms""";
Nice;
I don't receive a code . I tried numerous.;
Best app;
After 1 week use of threads app I found its not good because as per meta description there is no option for personal chat through inbox direct message. I still waiting for DM direct message features. I am getting regular many followers but I didn't talk anyone's person. So I would like to request you meta team please find the problem of direct message features and try to solve as soon as possible. 🙏🙏🙏;
Few features such as being able to add own comment when reposting, being able to control what to be shown in news feed(at least the type of content) and some other features are needed which give more ability to the user to decide what information to consume and what not would be very helpful;
I regret buying Huawei phone, it has its own apps and doesn't allow you to download important ones 😡;
When we delete the thread, then the Instagram account should not be deleted.;
Guys ! Read thread policies. When deactivate or delete thread account then Instagram account also deactivate or Delete... Please be careful & read policies;
Good Threads;
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT TWITTER WITHOUT TELLING ME YOU'RE NOT TWITTER.;
Wait. I can only get it on my phone, and I must have an Instagram account to use it. Really?;
A lack luster, feature deficit, copy cat attempt of liberal stank feces.;
I really hope Threads make a traslate button bottom of the each thread text like twitter, if like that many non english user like me will use this app 100 times more, I hope read english thread more without copy and paste the text to translate app;
Excellent;
Good better best😂😂;
Nice;
useless app 😂;
This app just gave me a heart attack because now I came to now about it that if I delete this app my instagram account will also get deleted. Just bring a new update to unlink my account. Or bring any solution for deleting it.;
Supar;
Best;
Fantastic;
Meta trying to make his Twitter is a failure, the only thing that makes them especial is the overcontrol in the privacy and the banning, and that sucks;
There is no practical difference in threads and Instagram. And I mostly see updates from people i don't follow.;
Nice;
So we are here now;
Good;
#tag is missing.;
Very nice app ❤;
Look like is a great application I haven't use it yet but will do it soon.;
Realy good app thank you admin🥰🥰🫡🫡;
Doesn't allow to remove it's account. & It's badge from Instagram is also not removing. This is not even close to twitter. Trash app!!;
When they first revealed the app, we thought it had potential. But it took only 5 minutes to see that.... NO. It's really just Instagram for tweet-like texts, and, like Instagram, it shows random people all the time. It really doesn't try to do what Twitter does, it's just Instagram;

when you merge twitter+insta+tiktok.. a hybrid useless product;
This is very nice app;
Less features than Twitter and a simple copy paste;
It's too good app;
Missing a bunch of things I would like (some of which they eventually plan to add). Since it is still in its infant phase there are some bugs and hiccups that need to be fixed such as the homepage glitching out while reloading, lack of order in which posts will arrive on the feed etc.;
Worse;
please add translate feature... mostly i cant understand when i follow japanese friend..😅;
Bakwas;
Nice wow 😮;
It needs more development and more features.;
Its a very cheap app dark mode are not supported 😒;
Nice..App..😍🥰😇;
Nice;
Real (Twitter is the best);
why you discontinue the older version of threads. That was just like massenger;
Everything on the app gets hazy after i enter into it. I cant even see anything. It perfectly installed bt doesnt work;
C'mon bro not giving u my info;
It's really nice ..... Smooth and fast as light.... I would love 🥰 everyone to download this wonderful app;

Instagram my account buluw tik and my reels and follow bda do please app very inpresn;
Better than Twitter;
All you 1stars, give it time. It's a fresh app that isn't trying to do it all. Lead devs interact with users and have explained what's to come. It's fine if you want the X Corp app where every feature breaks on launch but much of what you want is coming - personalized TL, search, etc. Don't get me wrong Meta is sinister but they know how to build an app.;
Amazing 🤩,;
ak editor 88;
Beautiful aap;
Literally Bad one;
Good;
I feel like apps need to have what's unique to them and users have to be able to sense the brand and differences. This is looking like a repeat of other apps like Twitter and Facebook. I love the idea of threads but I feel like it needs what stands out about it;
Fix this app, ty;

Sooo good app😍😍;

Better than Twitter;

Just another Twitter app.;
Trash;
Such a waste! I don't think we need Threads. It has absolutely nothing to offer. Instagram is more than enough. It's just a weaker version of an ordinary social media app. Want to delete my account but that will instantly delete my Instagram account too. That's very bad and cheap tactics. I'm very disappointed. Shall delete my Instagram too.;
5 stars cause it's not Twitter. -1 star because there isn't multi account support yet;
Bastard app;

Bad UI;
The feed is a real mess (like Instagram). I can't select to see just who I follow and can't be adjusted chronologically. Very frustrating.;
It's kinda messy because you see your reply on your profile.;

the app is rather performant and feels like Instagram. But nice app.;
it's really fun to use;
At least display Name followed by username like Twitter Ping on me incase its hard I help you;
Good;
When it has more features, I'll give it a real review.;
Lacks all the features except censorship;
Looks like lot of fake 1star reviews added into this. People have taken competition too seriously and taken some unethical steps to reduce the average rating of application.;
Zuckerberg has been listed as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions in 2008, 2011, 2016 and 2019 respectively and nominated as a finalist in 2009, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2022. He was named the Person of the Year by Time magazine in 2010, the same year when Facebook eclipsed more than half a billion users.[3][4][5] In December 2016;
There wasn't any need of half cooked app in hurry to compete twitter since app is lacking in loads of basic features. Hope devs are working hard to add features as well as troubleshooting the bugs.;
It's a fantastic app ever will this app take over Twitter 💫;
I mean it a good platform but it's has some loops holes like you can't delete the app and once you unhide badge from profile it's never gonna come back jerks!!!!🏇 I other words it's just Elonmusk vs markzukerberg ..... So yeah enough the triffle but keep its little safe and private to perform these activites on such platform;
Nice app just add a trending section you know.;
Self installation is major no no. Unreal.;
Best experience ever using this Threads;
Very good;
Nice, I like it and I think it's better than Twitter;

Great app with lots of potential. The app's social features are also fantastic. I can connect with friends who are also using Thread's, create groups, and even send direct invites to plan lunch dates. It's a great way to stay connected and coordinate lunch outings with ease.;
Twitter 🤣;
As social media aps go, this is awful. You would expect better with all of the trial an error our civilization has had over the last 20 years.;

Poor attempt at a new site. It's literally just a worse,less poorer version Instagram repackaged in a Twitter like format. No interesting features,no useful tools, and the same unnecessarily strict rules that only seen to apply for certain people.;
I like how you can choose to follow options;

I hope Good;
Nice app❤️✨👍;

Serves me better 😁;
very good app but i give 4 star cause this app is copy Twitter;
It's a great app but It would be better if I could switch accounts like Instagram. And I can't see how many people I follow. I would be grateful if these two things could be updated.;
It has potentials.;

I'm excited about this new app. :);

ABSOLUTELY GOOD;
WOW😲 Threads;
"Currently there is not any web interface option for computers, which is a HUGE issue for me (as well as for many others in my industry). I only access the competition (Twitter) via web browsers on my computer. I follow businesses and services in my industry during work (multi monitors in common place in my industry). No interest in following from my phone's little 6.8"" screen. Thanks for reading";
Good app;
Why the heck this even exist waste of time😂 useless app;
I think twitter is for reliable and easy to use. Threads only display the posts of followed people's.;
While scrolling text blinking and distorted, no way back to normal untill restart;

A little nitpick but my phone settings literally does not have a dark mode option. Please put it in the app, thanks.;
Keeps crashing when commenting;
It crashes a lot i hope they can fix it;
Good overall;
It could be a good app if it's feed was better. It shows more people I don't follow than I follow with no way to filter it. The last time I opened the app, it showed a rather profane post from an account I do not follow. So I deleted the app. I like regular Instagram a whole lot better.;
no translation option and no chats. Please add these features .a lot of blue check accs in the home that are not in my interests .;
I can share posts and stories more effectively than to other apps love this new app!!!!;
I dont know but i think see is good app iam wating for new update;
Good luck 🤞🤞🤞❤️;
Very very good social app;
Super 💞;
Useless;
It's a nice app although it's new and gat some features to work on Firstly we can't inbox on this whock Twitter had on their own app And secondly we can't switched between one acc to other unless one is logged out before the other is logged in And Thirdly Videos are slow to play and some don't even correspond with the audio So there is a lot to do It's a new app I hope it improves soon Great Kudos to Mark Zuckerberg on this And once all this features are improve I'ma high my stars;
nice app. meski fiturnya masi terbatas, i'll stay pasti kedepannya bakal update;
this is the amazing app , i like it❤️;

Not even able to login !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - I use FB login to sign in Instagram, Now in this app shows only login using instagram and no option to login using fb. when click login it ask username and password of instagram, as I dont have one ! what do you think of fb logged in users then ! then WTH added login via fb in insta.. not not allowing in this thread.... WORST !!!!;

It's very interesting better than twitter;
Nice app;
This has potential but the app functions like it was designed by people who have never used social media. I lost count of how many features are missing. It's so limited for an app designed by a billion dollar tech company. It seems as though it was prematurely released to appease shareholders. It's very messy. I also don't like all the censoring taking place. Unless it's blatant hate speech no one should be censored. Let people discuss differing opinions and fix your app.;
Mast;
Love u mahi sir ❤;
Nice 🥰;
Add true black out black theme. Not this wash out gray stuff. Saw that iphone users have different black. Why didn't you implemented the same true black out black for android as well?;
One time login in threads app then after I am not able unlink threads in Instagram...and temporarily bedge not remove on insta... very bad experience 😕;
We can't sign up;
The app was good at first and I really love but the only problem I have is I cannot post picture anymore, when I truly to post it automatically closes, but if you fix that I will give it a 5star;
Dictator ship against, I seriously hate anything against freedom of speech;
Can't upload anything.;
Can't logout and very bad tested app;
Love it so far but it needs improvement. It really needs hashtags. And I hate that celebs and business' are what you mainly see. I wanna see the smaller people. I want to be able to find artist. And I want a way to share my post to people who would be interested in it rather than hopeing a stranger likes it. The algorithm is working but it could use improvement.;
Nice and clear chatting and massage apps;
Good;

Don't download this app if u download this app and connect with your Instagram I'd if u delete this app your insta account will be;
Wanted to spite Elongated Muskrat, instead forced to sign up for Instagram just to log in, instead of just a regular sign in prompt, not even a Facebook or Google sign in option. Y'all need to learn from PC gaming that no one wants a dozen different launchers or logins for something as simple as this.;
Nice;
Nice aap but instagram best✨💖;
I was excited for the app but once it is loaded, I could not even use this app because it started acting weird. All pages are overlapping each other. I can't even interact with anything because as soon as I do, the page starts to behave like a bug. I tried to reinstall but it didn't fix the issue.;
There is no way to limit all the trash coming into the feed. Rubbish. Twitter may be a cesspool but atleadt you can limit it.;
Privacy Concerns;
Like it so far. For a new app it's pretty solid.;
This is better than using tritter even though i haven't used twitter but I give Instagram and their new app Threads 100/ 100 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😊😊😊🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗;
Sumpahnya aku ingin tutup akun threads tanpa hapus akun instagram!!!;
I don't know who would enjoy this app but I don't want to meet them.;
awesome;
Not a bad app (it runs smoothly and interfaces well with Instagram) but definitely could be improved. The home page is flooded with completely untailored posts that have nothing to do with any of the accounts I follow. Without tags it is hard to find new accounts to follow based on what I am interest unless the keyword is in their username.;
"There are limited features as compared to Twitter, which is what it's trying to be, but overall, it isn't poorly designed frankly wish there was more of a ""recommended"" feed or other features akin to twitter that goes beyond who you follow on instagram. I'll probably write another review as the app develops";

Okay, pretty good start but there are a few deal breakers. #1 Carries your Instagram account, Anonymity is lost if you want to use the login for both #2 There isn't a page where I could only see posts from the people I follow, only the home page exists which is good at recommending new stuff but I can't find ANYTHING back after I scroll pass it once #3 Can't save photos. Why. Apart from theese, app works perfectly. Had no issues setting up, running, using;
Its a useless app i could live my life without it.. its a waste of storage and unnecessary.. twitter is better in my opinion.. not even close;

It’s good app;

It is like we are forced to use the app.;
Working well know!;
Nice application;
An excellent start to a new social network! The app runs smoothly on my Pixel, it hasn't crashed once for me. Yes, this Meta app collects data, but if you already have Facebook and Instagram installed on your phone, adding Threads doesn't make a difference. Love the interface, it's clean and easy on the eyes.;
It's a new trending app ..it's good but I think that there is something you should fix it... like there is no conversation feature... sometimes it's lack when you scrolling ...in settings there should be set dark theme...if you have android version 10 or you have iOS 14 latest version then you can enable dark theme if you don't have you can't....but it is not so bad not so good...😃;
We need message option;
cool;

What's the point to follow someone if your feed is bloated with non-followed people? Mastodon separates between followed and instance/fediverse related;

I give 5 star but the developer should make something important which is the ability to download image videos etc;
I cant delete my account;
I don't know why this application doesn't delete my profile. I don't want my profile on this thread. If I delete my account then why does the Instagram account get deleted too.;
Nice;
Data collection is massive. Breach of privacy.. worst.;
This version would be decent if we were talking about a beta, but it is the final version and it lacks many QoL improvements. There is no option to see only the threads of people you follow in chronological order, can't use hashtags, the algorithm doesn't take into account the profiles you follow or interact with and recommends anything, cannot perform keyword searches, some videos don't play audio, and many more bugs and non-existing options that should have been there in the first place.;
Following back = permanently disabled account?! Forget this app. Apparently if you follow back too many people that have followed you threads will suspend you. Then you go through the appeal process, including submitting a selfie with all your info they ask for plus a one time code and then threads permanently disables the account. Forget Threads. What a waste of time.;
TWITTER S BEST HAI 😅;

You must have an Instagram account to get this. There is no way to just build an account on threads!;
Copy copy Cheating Not install;

"My name is OBENDAILY on Threads and Instagram, if you read this post it means you are alive. If you continued reading it means you are using intern€t. If you realized my spelling of ""internet"" included a special character (€) it means you are keen. This makes you my friend because I like people who are very observant. LET'S CONNECT ON THREADS. For the records, I love this app, so will rate it stars 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟. I wish there were options for 10 stars, I would choose that for Threads...";
Lets'go;
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💪;
Just a cheap copy;
Hate it;
Twitter 3rd copy🥱;
Fabulous..;
So far so good!;
Controlled and censored by the same dicatorship as fb and ig. No thank you.;
good very good;
👻;
Kinda Clean UI Better Than Twitter but needs a bit more updates too make it Twitter level....maybe add chats and input stories and maybe a space update which was in Twitter. And for love of god pls do NOT ADD ADS IN THIS LET IT BE THIS CLEAN UI;
😇😇;
better than twitter;
This app has been frustrating me since. I can't post or make a comment and my app keep logging out on its own. I just updated it and yet still same problem. Please you guys should do something about it;
Borring...new Revenue source for meta..😝😝😝;
Nope, still connected to instagram and all Meta's data , can't be trusted .;
Very cool rn, but would like to see who I'm following on threads as well as topic searches opposed to profile only in the search section;
Koi bhi download mat karo plz barbad hojaige account se paise jatne lagte hai verify karte hi.. Puri screen record karke YouTube pe dal dunga... YouTube pe jake dekho... Chennal name amitnagod;
Bad services;
Thumri Maa ki salo mera insta account dlt ho gya chal ni raha 😡😡😡😡;
Wow;
No privacy. Just collects and abuses your data;
best;
Too much not needed permissions;
Worst optimize I've ever seen...;
The best so far;
Best of luck for the best journey;
Free Speech is non-existent;
It's have access to my very personal information, and it's not acceptable for a social application like this !!!!;
There are SOOOOO many things wrong with this app. 🤣 When is the cage match between you and chunk going down? I will pay pay per view prices to see this;
I've been using from couple days... it's found good...Sometimes little lagging is there while loading/opening threads apart from that, all feels okay....cheers to the team :);
cheap copy of twitter 😂😂;
More options;
Best App;
Required more features;
Better than Twitter 🤠;
Very baaad;
Mast Apps hai bhai sab;
Bring something new.We don't need something which is already in ther market.;
"Fair- Everytime trying to start a ""thread"" and when I try post or add a photo it kicks me out completely.";
Elon Musk ka Twitter toh gaya 😂;
This is best 😀;
My good cousin 😊💘;
Cool;
Love it! I'm tired of all that complicated stuff and this kind of platform is exactly what I need.;
Good;
Cool;
If only i can register in this app instread of donwloading instagram to register as well... Kinda foolish, because not everyone is an instagram user and i do not intend to use instagram.;
Supb🤘👍👍;
you should be able to share someones insta acct from the instagram app to threads. just a suggestion;
Nice app 👌 easy to use;
Earning ki ideas dalo aur verification ka;
Cool rollout with lots of room for improvement. Does give me Twitter c2008 vibes, and I'm here for it. Pack in more features, and that score will increase for sure.;
I forgot my Instagram password and unable to retrieve now I'm not able to login threads;
Abb iss app se ak girlfriend to de do 🥲💔;
This app seriously killed twitter!!!;
👍👌;
Yes ❤️👈 you too;
Nice;
I am new here;
Everything been going on well since day one till yesterday it stated telling me that, they restrictly certain activity to protect the community and it says I try again later,what could be the reason please help me( my handle is Sun bae -256.;
Not able to see anything ,it's like scrolling itself fastly, blurred image;
Use paniru solren;
*can't edit past posts (esp. wrong spelled words) *don't know why can't upload other pics (pic size?);
Very nice aap;
As there is no translation option, trying to copy the text will result with the app crashing.;
So great 👍;
reduce sex worker;
Since this app is linked to Instagram, it's not possible to use a new user name, but the user name you have already setup on Instagram, which is pointless for a new app. I wanted to create a new user name, but it's not possible here sadly. Also, WAY too much privacy-invasive permissions requested by this app. Uninstalling right away.;
perfect;
Good app;
It's a simple wow experience. No chit chat only post and value and experience sharing..love it..hope to see new features in upcoming update.;
bad app not a followers;
Seems great. Still a long process to greatness. Please fix the notifications. I want my Woj and Shams alerts.;
Great;
"I don't understand the purpose of this app. It's just Instagram, but worse. Also, since I don't have ""enough"" followers, it pollutes my timeline with random popular/viral nonsense. Super meh.";
Great app and well done;
Please reduce the size of the app. Also launch a lite version of threads , please.;
Fails to upload so often. Can't easily search topics. Hopefully thus is due to the crazy uptake and it improves soon;
Can't get code to sign up, you only text me six numbers;
😱 OMG ✴️✨✨✨✨✨✨;
Koy khash baat nahi hai;
Mark Zuckerberg rest see no dey their people account for this one allow people to bomb and have money abeg;
"Kya Faltu App Hai ""Threads"" Koi Organic Reach Ka Namu Nishan Nahi Hai Kam Se Kam Views Count System To Hona Tha Na..🥴.";
It's ok but it's missing a lot of features and some of the things it has already is pretty buggy. I can't get videos to play with sound on. Either you watch with no sound or it freezes immediately.;
"Nice please follow me on Instagram "" musaib official";
Elon musk 🥴;
Please update to text message to anyone.;
Its just 'okay' for me. There are no hashtags, no trending topics and most of all, no following page!!! Why should i see threads of people who i don't follow? It annoys me.;
There is a problem with the video they are always mute 🔇 we have to change this situation to have voice;
Want to like it so bad but it's not good. You can't search for anything but other accounts. You can't type in any words in the search bar and find other people talking about the same thing. Not trending topics. It's only a one timeline of people that threads suggests to you and its usually a celebrity or an influencer. The app isn't good.;
Super sir 🔥💯👌;
Great, love the functionality;
Gradually becoming what Twitter is all about...zero privacy! Keep showing lots of unfollowed profiles.;
I'm tired of reading cringe tweets from blue check accounts that are trying too hard to farm engagement.;
There is not any options to download a video or photo. but ok !;
If it wasn't tied to Instagram I'll make one;
Ok;
Why cant i see only those i follow? Why do i have to see the world? Please can you add a feature that allows mw to only see threads from those i follow;
I don't understand what is app? There's nothing. I removed it after 10 min.;
Good;
Bad Twitter knockoff;
worst than twiter And also all our personal information was absorbed;
Great app fast work app I got verified;
Good 👍;
Bad copy;
I love it;
good;
Twiter copy;
So lazy application i dont like;
Very bad app for the the personal data privacy;
It's ok about app but please separate from Instagram because not everyone's choice to connect thread with instagram.2nd thing is delete thread account it also delete Instagram account which is not fare with us.So kindly solve this problem.Otherwise thread is a very good app.And kindly can you reply if without deactivated thread account uninstall this app what happened? If you separate Instagram from thread more and more people will happy and they can use this app without any fear.This may help;
😎👊;
Love you and your family and friends is Stan 59 and share photos;
Been on here 2 hours, but there are bugs like, LOTS OF BUGS. threads failing to upload mostly.;
Great App;
Just download it to give a 1 star, fxxk you mark Zuckerberg alien;
Hard to find the people you follow as it just gives you hundreds of random posts.;
I have not been able to download the application.it stopped when it reached 99%.;
It's so nice;
same algorithms, same content so nothing new. when all meta use same algorithms across their social media what's the point of adding another.;
Lacking a lot of features and functionality, so the user experience is currently far inferior to Twitter. Really only useful to people who have a large following on Instagram, the growth potential for smaller accounts is virtually non existent. Nice clean UI tho;
നൈസ്;
Bakwas;
It ain't working on my phone......😡😡😡😡;
A great start, but it needs lots of improvements. Only being able to see posts by followers on your feed for one, an option to edit pictures and videos before you post them, it's also common for the app to crash while trying to upload pictures and videos.;
Good;
This is app very best aap 🥰;
Good for all;
has lots of potential! people are complaining that its missing aome basic features, which it is. but they were mostly focusing on making sure the app runs smoothly, which it does. has almost completely replaced taitter for me already and with some good quality of life upgrades it can be much better than twitter;
Meta and Twitters primary goal is to sow discord in the world and to brainwash. If you want to fall into that trap, then please download this app.;
Keeps crashing when I'm typing a reply to anything. Very frustrating;
"App doesn't work. Enter username and password and get ""something went wrong, please try again"". Can't do anything or see anything other than this message.";
Trending;
Not it. Be original;
It has a bug so it doesn't works for me, I can't see anything;
We need a save button for videos and pictures;
Not Twitter!;
Some of us do not want to use Instagram. Why is it necessary to access Threads via Instagram? Why there is no alternative registration/login without Instagram?;
Very good for a first release, and bugs are being fixed noticeably quickly.;
Can't see any use of the apo.;
Garbage;
Nice app;
Great app ❤;
Nice app , thanks Zuck;
Good app but it needs more features;
Copy paste;
Can't log on without instagram acct;
Anything but tweeter is a good thing;
Zuck is a cuck;
Good Apps;
I'm really happy with this app;
Complete nefarious data scraper. Awful.;
آشغال و مرخرف کپی درجه چند از توییتر;
Very helpful;
Tha best;
Lacks real substance compared to the app it's imitating to be. You have to be a self loathing troglodyte to want anything to do with this.;
King always king;
"Every positive review you see that only says ""Great app! 5 stars!"" Or ""Love it"" etc is actually just a paid for bot account out of China or India. Zuckerbucks is a tool and buys and sells your data with every facebook/Instagram/threads profile you use. Just....don't. Wake up people!";
Wow;
Closes the app in the middle of typing or to post.;
Very boring application, poor rehash of twitter;
کیری اند جاکشانه;
It's a wonderful app;
I'd really love to be able to save posts. It's a great feature from Twitter and I think Threads should have it.;
Downloaded and linked an account from Instagram and the threads app caused my Instagram app to crash within seconds every time I tried to open the app. Uninstalling the threads app fixed all the Instagram issues I was having. Wild considering it's all one metamess, you'd think it would play together well...;
Data collection practices stop me downloading this App.;
Experienced a bug that made the app unusable, while scrolling the previous content continues to stay on the screen, not allowing me to see anything. Hopefully this bug gets fixed soon;
الصلاحيات التي يطلبها التطبيق اكثر من احتياج تشغيله ولا انصح به;
So bad app;
"Surprisingly really nice. Not going to lie. But the image and video quality is so bad. Like the compression is so so so terrible. If that was changed and we could have better video and image quality it would be so much better <33 please add that lol otherwise its actually really nice. Also having a ""following only"" browse feature would be so cool too 👍👍 new feature req. Being able to switch between mult accs!!";
Trying out the app. It's very new at this time, so who knows. So far it seems alright, there's content, a lot of big names are already using it. I've never used Twitter, so I don't know how it compares. I will state here, I've heard rumors that Threads will be actively censoring nazi content, and I'm here for that. Looking forward to nazi-free social media experience;
خـ.را حرفيا يعني لو عوزت اغير المحتوى الي بيطلعلي اعمل ايه دلوقتي;
Useless app;
If you enjoy censorship and data collection this is your platform;
Fantastic It's good better than Twitter;
👍;
No option for new usernames;
I don't find my following and followers list. And;
No option to only see posts from people you follow on the home feed or view posts chronologically, just the same firehose of jumbled algorithm garbage that infests IG.;
I wish i could but i logged off Instagram by accident a while back and cant remember my log in. I asked them for help and they shut me out. Glad. Good riddance;
A good start as an alternative to twitter but with a long way to go. Why on earth is it not available on PC?;
amazing for everyone they need to have it on computers too this app is very good :D for phones i reccomend it for everyone;
It has a lot of potential, I feel that its missing a few features such as a following/suggestions option on the FYP. an easier setup for being able to see and read replys, I find it difficult to see the replys for a specific post. Another feature I would recommend is a like count on the account page.;
It's Instagram not Twitter;
I don't have Instagram account;
A app with the Hardware of Twitter & The software of Instagram.;
Cool👍;
The feed is very irrelevant.;
New experience. I think it will be better more;
Decent app with the most basic of microblogging functionality. Only big due to the brand name - had this been any startup, this would have been dead in the water. Lacks basic functionality such as a web interface and user sign-ups without having to tie an Instagram account. Block feature is also not working as you can still see the posts of a blocker user.;
app doesn't work properly, it keep crash;
"When I am trying to login then I am getting an error like"" An unexpected error occurred Account. Please try logging in again."" Almost from 5 days. Why?? I have already changed my password from Instagram and trying but haven't get any success response";
App Copied from Twitter;
Make sure meta will add more features.;
Hate social media but Hate mr musket more.. the more users of threads the more angry the retard gets.. let us all join and make the Auti cry like a girl :D;
Nice;
🙌;
Op;
I downloaded it 5-6 hours after release and it was crashing and a lot of glitches were there;
This app is so good. I just hope that it has edit and pin to top options too;
The app works well and is great but it needs to open up it's policies for use of certain language as well as certain content (with of course content moderation).;
Banned on my first post. Back to Twitter.;
Run great and im glad that there's a Twitter alternative. But, it works more like an instagram extension then another app. It might as well be implemented within it rather then make me jump back.;
This is a winderfull appp;
Guuu;
App is jaka naka...Hm As Rafi;
Fan-freaking-tastic!;
No hay porno, ni libertad de expresión;
Shows posts from random popular pages I'm not interested in instead of posts for the pages I follow!! Please fix this asap!!;
Nice app;
Worst app;
Checking....;
You have to have intergarm to sign up;
Best;
Overall better than Twitter It's missing a couple of minor features that make Twitter a little bit better like your header but past that it's basically the same but better because elon's ruined the Twitter platform. Apparently there's some bugs that you should be aware of if you go installing this. I haven't experienced one.;
👍;
It's alright its pretty much Twitter, I imagine it'll be a less political place;
Na, too like Twitter but owned by Meta. I'll take Twitter 2.0 over Threads any day. No censorship which is all Meta/Facebook does...;
Decent, but drains battery and just has less features than Twitter;
Tried and did not like at all. Back to Twitter.;
Buggy, no interaction, couldn't uninstall without uninstalling Instagram. Pretty shallow interaction. Pass.;
Lmao eat my home made vanilla and chocolate, Zuck.;
Crashes everytime i try to post;
Outstanding;
Why don't you give us an option where we can see the posts of people only we follow and not n number of random meaningless stuff in which we are not interested at all?;
I highly recommend this Threads an instagram app the content please follow, share, and support this app😍✔️ Please ডাওনলোড this app😊😊 Thank you.;
Nice 👍 hai super;
Useless;
Thank you so much;
amazing app;
Woke;
Once I open the app shows overlapped content consistently Giving us a dizziness and irritation. 2. Unable to download the media like photos making it very difficult to use this if we want the media.;
Good experience;
"Good Start, but intermittent bugs. Today, as I was following people back, it would periodically start flashing this box that said, ""Something went wrong, try again,"" that box would vanish & then reappear like a strobe with no way to exit, other than force stopping the app. Then, once restarted, all the people I'd just followed would just show as new requests, even though I'd just followed them? Frustrating! These glitches all started since the update yesterday";
Ladkiya pot jayenge na;
It works, but the home feed is nothing but strangers talking about stuff I don't care about. I would prefer to just see posts from the people I follow. That's why I follow them. I like the lack of a trending tab, but I see no point in using this app until the home tab is cleaned up and we get a followers view.;
Copycat;
Copycat;
No volume, everything keeps glitching, Twitter is better.;
Don't like the scrolling. It still lacks features. User can't explore communities easily yet.;
One of my main reasons for liking Twitter was to follow great journalists and hear and share breaking news, but since Threads has banned Canadian news I don't see a reason to bother trying it out.;
Thanks and nice aaps;
Nice app;
Twitter is better;
Ye threads Jo hai ye ekdam Twitter ka copy h 😏;
Highly censored. Pass;
It's promising but please keep my feed stuff I follow. That is my biggest issue with that other app.;
It looks like Twitter but I don't understand why you have to have an Instagram account to be able to use what is supposed to be related to Twitter.;
It's so boring, pretty much it is just a comments section out of instagram. And deleting threads account will delete instagram, and on top it collects and track all user details.;
Worst app. Never download. Copy of twitter. Fake things. Now I can't even delete it.;
Best app;
Nice app to connect with world;
It's awesome and Twitter has been unmarked, it's fun to do that😘;
Nice;
So beautiful app;
Twitter copyright theft I am sad for Elon Musk 😪😪;
Super;
Aplikasi bagus. Alternatif dari IG saat untuk orang yg suka nulis akan senang dengan aplikasi ini.;
💗💗💗💗💗I love this app;
It's a really good style of Instagram app;
My Respect for Twitter after this app came out 📈;
Worst app👎;
Good 👌;
Which is best thing;
Useless;
Copycat app with least use;
improve more conversations;
It's literally a poor rip-off of Twitter with more questionable data ethics (more tracking & more of the censorship industrial complex).;
Story Thevaych Option Dya Jara 😅🤣🙏;
Twitter wanna be. Just as expected they are censoring speech and shadow banning accounts that don't align with their views. Delete > uninstall.;
When I open the app. The login procedure goes good but suddenly bug appears in the screen and I can't operate the app properly. Face very difficulties to log out and also uninstalling the app is not working;
Not well tested lots of crashes;
Good;
10000000% better than Twitter;
Good;
Useless.......and not even closely comparable with the MIGHTY twitter.........meta needs to improvise this app if it wants to compete with twitter;
Menarik lho;
Good app;
App doesn't work;
It very wonderful app;
Is find apps;
bad app needs improvments;
User Experience 👎;
This app a very dug full and not viwes;
Copy-paste from twitter. Nothing original, new or interesting. Plagiarism;
Super app;
App is very nice;
nice app;
i have an issue while seeing the data. contacted for support through given mail address but no response...... still waiting to see hiw was the application;
Worst ia lost my id 🆔😡😡😡😡😡😡😡;
I don't know how this app works and whether it can earn money or not I don't know anything but I'm giving it a review it's very good it can earn money or not I don't know if money can be earned It is good if money can be earned;
Nice app ❤️❤️❤️;
Good;
Show me the updates from the people that I FOLLOW. Why pushing random accounts to the feed? I haven't come across a single friend's account in the last two days.;
Superb;
Amazing Ads free experience and pure content at full scale. This is what we need. There should be different types of tick for verification of users. Private user, Normal user, content creator and Pro User.;
Yamunguamani;
Finally an update that fixes my issues. Thanks;
Bad;
Threads có cái gì đặc biệt đâu ta?;
Copy cat lizard;
I hate that you keep showing all accounts I don't follow and less of the accounts I follow. It felt like this is a subtle way to advertise accounts instead of running ads. Both annoying.;
it's a really good app,i sometimes don't receive any notifications on it unless i open it then notifications come in but it's good nothing to complain about so far.;
Very good;
This app is now good...use it;
bad app;
The app is completely compatible with my device, does not crash unlike what other users experienced apparently. Also, it's better than twitter. It's a yes from me.;
Excellent;
Aap is so interesting. But it is not good;
Good;
Copy cat;
This is good;
I ❤❤o;
nice app;
Achcha nahin lag raha hai;
I'm with Elon;
Better than twitter;
It's a good apps, but there is much things that needs to improve. We can't edit the photo, we cannot choos the photo from the album.;
useless, Twitter best;
Suck;
The best app;
Nice ❤😊;
Faltu application with lot of bugs. Bhai isko banane ki akhir jarurat kya thi. Keep your time and money in right approaches.;
Copy;
A veritable firehose of toxic waste.;
Bad;
Better than;
Poor Rip off of Twitter;
Power full peopel make apps powerfull;
Ahhhhh;
app can login with instagram but not with facebook and gmail it needs to be fixed . please Please 🙏;
3rd x i ex 33 err e3s;
Its amazing;
Twitter ki copy ha;
Duplication of twitter or nothing be;
Honestly,Better than Twitter!!;
Much needed solace from the bird experience....;
Total bs app. No concern for privacy ,just another attempt by meta to get our data. Would prefer Twitter anyday over it, it's just a leftist attempt to destroy twitter;
Nice;
UPDATE: App works perfectly fine since the update. ORIGINAL REVIEW: The app runs fine, but I can't check out my account's Following list, as well as other accounts Following lists either to follow accounts I recognize from other platforms (the same Following list error/glitch has been happening on Instagram, too). Hopefully this error/glitch will be addressed soon in a future app update.;
🇮🇳🚩Jai shree Ram 🚩🇮🇳 Dosto;
Threads nice application;
A friend was banned for health advice..;
I'll stay with Twiter!;
It's an absolute copy of Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg needs to bring something new, always copying an already existing application and releasing as your own. Develop something new which you can say with pride that it is what is made by myself. Copying Twitter won't help.;
My thread is full of stuff I have zero interest in. I have to scroll down and mute tons of rubbish before I get to anything I follow;
HORRIBLE buggy bad wannabe twitter. Drains battery bug. Heats up all devices. Interferes with wifi and mobile network settings. Ignores permission denials. Breaks privacy apps settings. This should be banned and illegal. Horrible. Google play should be ashamed.;
Twitter is good;
I want the threads I'd on ny Instragram bio How can I add that;
Great design and awesome features but sometimes app isn't working prorperly and showing insta followers on threads and somehow disappearing threads posts. Need little bit fixing.;
Copy Paste of Twitter;
I cannot follow the people who follow me.some problem is there;
App is fine. Beats the monstrosity that Twitter has become under Elongated Musk.;
This is very amazing app 😍🤩 😍🤩;
Who had come to see elon musk comment click on yes;
You have to delete your insta account to get rid of it. Dumbest thing I've ever heard of. I don't use Twitter and I don't want to use this.;
So much better than Twitter. Ever since Elon Musk took over, he's been ruining that platform. Threads feels like a breath of fresh air in comparison.;
Bed app;
Very bad app;
It lacks some of the important features and timeline is such a mess.;
Wawe new life;
Ye Maine only sarukh khan ke liye install Kiya hai only for SRK #JAWAN;
I love the app so much .. my pictures no longer auto crop. Hopefully in the next update there will be an album .;
Nice app;
Same people different app. We are at the saturation stage that all people are doing is transfering everything we have seen to yet another platform. Influencers are desperate to be the first big thing. Same people, another home.;
Good app thank you #mark;
Accha app hai;
Facebook 🤬;
Very buggy, initially after getting it, it took over 60 hours before any content showed whatsoever on my feed, despite me following many people and my partner having loads on her feed. Recently, it took me about 48 hours to upload something on it while Instagram and other apps worked perfectly fine. Multiple attempts occurred both on wifi and on mobile data with no results. It'd be really cool if the bugs could get sprayed down some more, maybe get Daxter on it.;
😘😘😘;
Really don't like how its feed is filled with people I don't follow 😅;
theres a text limit up to 50 characters only, i cant write freely because of that, sue it;
Very bad app because of copy twitter not better than Twitter it will launch of competition of Elon Musk Don't install this app I'm installed this app but after that can use this app then I was uninstalled;
Well it's kinda good, but I prefer Twitter more;
It is a bad app;
"Meh. I really wanted a good alternative to Twitter but this isn't it. The UI is pretty basic looking and there's just no settings. It starts showing loads of threads from people you aren't following and you can't stop it. It's basically always stuck on the ""for you"" section on Twitter.";
Nice 👍💯💯 apps;
Great app✅;
Bahut hi mast app hai;
4th class;
Abhi bhi kuch baki hai Jo ye threads aagya only instgram not threads 18+ okay good might 😅;
Love crossing platforms, mixing up the Status Quo and yes they are a pop group.;
Baki sab accha ha but story wla system krdo people visit krenge profile followers increase honge my insta..official_sharmaji3122;
بسیار یک برنامه عالی است ❤❤❤;
TRASH;
I liked the Threads, i felt good😊;
Good app but more can be done;
Twitter Copy Cat, LoL 🤣;
Threads team Add photo and video download option and add save post option also Upcoming update Thank you 😊;
Everything that was wrong and extremely wrong with Twitter pre 2023 this verbatim twitter clone is, from the fake trendings, to the horrible recommendations in your feed, and the permanent synchronization to your Instagram. This platform from Meta seeks to bring back thought police and cancel culture through the Google Plus-YouTube method of signups. All the above plus Zuck selling your data.;
Super super;
Awesome app;
Twitter is much better than threads;
Nice;
Useless. Half hearted attempt to match Twitter. Not recommended !!;
This app like twitter so it's like okk okk;
Best app;
World no.1 app;
Good;
Needs more development, but most definitely a good alternative for Twitter and great for anyone who likes keeping up with real verified people, not bots. Anyone giving lower than a 4 star it just butt hurt Elon fangirl.;
Why are there only suggested posts? Where is chronological order?;
Following list doesnt load sometimes.;
It's so good but it's a dark version of Twitter 😂 You should try something new 😀;
👍👍👍👍;
Twitter is better than thizz;
Why it should play video automatically?;
Best social app;
Good 😊💯;
New app new environment love it!;
Bakwas worst app nothing innovative;
What about privacy? The app is collecting all the private datas such as photos videos location phone numbers email msgs every thing this app has serious privacy issues i would never recommend anyone to use this app;
Will it affect to my Instagram! If I'm deactivating threads and then uninstall?;
Miss u 😘🥺🥺 d;
Time wasting app.;
ভালো;
It's too Good;
Good stuff;
Needs timeline improvement, hashtags/topics and a proper search function (not just finding users) in order to truly be viable;
Cheating can't be an inovation;
selah;
Just a really bad Instagram wrapper. I doubt they even planned on making this before twitter outtage.;
💩;
Enjoying it so far;
Good 👍;
Its a twitter with extra censorship :);
Tweeter copy;
Good;
🤔🤔🤔🤔;
Great app so far.;
The app takes too much personal data to run an app.;
Bad copy of Twitter. They even using Twit word and same bird logo for it. This is how scam they are.;
even truth social is better than this;
I am experiencing a problem with video sounds. If the audio is muted video plays fine. When I turn the audio on, video stops playing. Both in feed and when I click on video and open it, it happens.;
Its not useful to spend time better one is twiter👍;
1 star ke liyak he ye aap;
Horrible won't let me login;
Do not like it, this is bad threads app 👎👎 Only one it app from Instagram;
Just a cool app;
So much room for improvement.....;
Osm;
FOUND BUG: Click onto the picture in the thread to go full screen, swipe out to get out of full screen and immediately click on a different thread. Results in black screen. Hope that helps!;
AMAZING;
Zee fashion trendzz (follow);
yaa;
Good app;
Hello Your program is really great There is a lot of room for improvement I am an Iranian and I love your program I am happy that a journal was created that can show all the feelings Thank you Mr. Zak;
Awesome then Twitter...Good Job 👍;
Cannot scroll, app is a glitch;
It's not possible to send message in this application please add it to the next version;
It's a new platform to old gathering..welcum wid new journey;
Blah another waste of time zuck. Your lack of freedom of speech is irritating.;
It's is laggy and very slow, Twitter Experience is the best;
Nice;
Better than Twitter.;
This app iss have not use Instagram account bhi deactivate ho ya hai;
Twitter better than threads.. I used threads but not feel the app because threads is not unique...;
Don't wast your precious time keep yourself busy in other activities;
Nice app good nice app thanks for instergrem app is very very good app nice this app 👌❤️💥💯💯;
Nice 👍;
Totally trash;
1 star ⭐ for cheating 😁;
Best so;
Bd;
Not bad for a first try, but there's posts from folks I don't know (and don't give a fig about), and the bloody videos auto play. Nothing like using my data for Meta's ad services, eh?!;
Yes we can;
Threads is a new life of a social media;
Boycott;
Copy paste 🤣;
♥️;
Not good this app;
Ousting app 💙;
I don't like it 🙂;
So good so far;
Power of stan fans downloader;
Worst copy ever! Pls stop copying other apps. Earth and it's people do not need another Twitter app.;
Nothing is new about this aap;
Twitter copy cat;
good;
No control over feed.;
Cannot login with gmail. Insta id needed. Plz solve for non insta users.;
Aswum !;
Zucky people are gonna rate your app one star, and you can only keep coping;
❤️❤️;
make it can use username;
I love this app, but, sadly it eats up my battery like crazy.;
"I wonder if you were waiting to be told.... I just wonder. When refreshing for new feeds, you don't just snap the view to the latest feed. Just show avatars of accounts with new [recent or yet-to-be-viewed posts] and then we can scroll up to view at our pace. Again, I don't know if you were waiting to be told 😒... Until then, all you can boast of is ""look how many we are now 🤪!'.... 🤡s";
Twitter better;
I don't want Zuck to win, I just want Elon to lose;
good;
Osm bhai;
I find it quite annoying that you cant log in with your Google ID and have to instead log in/create an account with Instagram! Also changing your username or name in general... you have to do it via Instagram. I would love to try the App out, but considering that I always have separate accounts accross different Social Medias, I have to wait, until Meta decides to review this issue, in which Im apparently not the only one.;

Nic application ❤️;
Pom pom package 📦😁;
Bad experience;

Like Instagram users can't turn off autoplay option for videos.;
So many bugs;

Good app dis i like dis app;
Amazing 😍😍😍 app;
This just a Twitter copy....not usefull 😑;
It's exceptional;
Absolutely Useless;
No competition with Twitter 👎 Bad App....Zuck is a Cuck ☠️;
Wish o wasn't Connect it to IG. If ypu delete threads it delete IG. That suck.;
Needs more improvements.;
Update fixes this issue🖤 - Good. Not Great I really can't believe in order to change my profile picture as a verified user I have to do it via Instagram and even when I do it from there it does not change. It is said that I need to subscribe and give ID in order for me to have a display picture. Kind dumb and unfair;
What is the point of this app? I have tried it but its just a separated Instagram comment section. Maybe they're going after non Instagram users because why would you use this if you are already on Instagram? I just thought they would've done something more adventurous.;
Nice app;
No respect for data privacy. Usual META behaviour.;
Wow;
This app is a copy of Tweeter, actually tweeter is better than Threads and Koo is better than tweeter.;
Bintang 1 biar gak ada bocah2;
This app is not good at all. Lacks basic features.;
Can you delete my account and data in threads?;
Its good app;
Great;
The app's great...But y'all should work on putting the dark mode version.;
Best;
I am seeing too many celebs posts and not enough of my followers and friends. Not sure if that is normal life.;
Yep twitter nerds are crying on the comments;
Wow amazing app 💓;
My life my country The is my love My faesbook id Hafez siam hasan;

Another way for meta to track you. That's it. They saw a gap forming in the industry and decided to take more for themselves. Meta very nearly has a monopoly on social media and is known to nab everything from your device they can just to sell for profit to unknown parties.;

Nice 👍;
This is good app thank you;

Nice 🙂;
Very good app nice work;

Bug fixed . Thanks;
It may be better than twitter;
Good 👍;
Good❤️‍🩹;
Improve the bug like glitches in screeen after opening it.;
Nice;
Hide bage is not good 💔 so please unhide bage opinion in update;
It is a cheap copy of Twitter.;
I don't trust any app from Facebook or Instagram. They need to be sued for being racist and sexist m they have harmed my mental health for too long and need to be shut down immediately.;
Everyone try to be funny and meaningless;
Pls consider to separate it from insta honestly. Like it's quite unsafe to be logged with only one acc and one password, if one go down, another will too.;
"Why does this even exist? It's literally the same as my instagram feed; same people, same accounts, same posts... for what? I already have instagram. Also the terms are extremely invasive of personal info. No thanks! Uninstalled.";
App doesn't load;
Simpson already pridicted this app . Illuminati companies.;
It is a very good program, thank you from Insta and Trades company 💗🧃;
Elon Musk's Twitter >> Zuckerberg's Threads;
Wow it is an amazing app I really love it;
Team MARK ZUCKERBERG;
msta;
Anything other than Twitter will do now. Hope it can stimulate meaningful and mature discussions at the same time being fun;
Somehow, my threads app works now. Wow. Check my edit history to see screenshot of how it was. Now, using the app, it seems to be solid. Feels like instagram with a different skin on it. I dont dislike so far. Will continue to use and will update my review in a bit.;
The scroll is not that smooth. I have to work harder to scroll.;
Thanks Achcha app;
You can't just copy and paste it... Twitter will always be superior than Threads..!;
"Kya ghatiya app hai🤬 Ek bhi ladki reply nehi karti, ""DON’T INSTALL THIS APP""";
People need to realise that all their data is being stolen and sold on to big corporations. It's time to delete social media.;
Rubbish wish I could give IT a No Star Rating but then again where could you put Zero star rating 🙄 and let others know.....you need an Instagram account to login in, this resulting in more data collection 'privacy out of the window collected from Facebook Meta team!!!!';
Good app;
I m muslim n I m not support this app;
Wow 😲;
Nice Instagram;
Vekar;
Actually this app doesn't work properly. As soon as I opened this app, there will be overlapping of everything I see la. I don't think it will work la 🥴;
Twitter>;
Yes, the app is quite good but a lot of things need to be improve.;
Really good altenative app for twitter...the ui is good really clear to understand....but i hope that you can add the function to download the photo of the post;
Riddled with bots and spyware by Facebook;
Cambridge Analytica;
Yeah this is way more nicer and easier to use than Twitter just add DMS camera maybe even like reels or something like that and this app doesn't have any gliches;
Lot of bugs in login Followers are dead Which is not active automatically get 150 followers without any close friends;
Great app;
Thought it would be a new nice app, after a day. It is broken and trash;
Love the app, but it crashes randomly when I try to post comments. Anyone got any ideas on how to fix this?;
0 privacy;
This app sucks. It's key problem is that it CANNOT BE REMOVED WITHOUT DELETING INSTAGRAM. Do not download this app. I don't see many people using it either. It asks for many permissions when creating an account with no warning that you cannot remove the threads link from your profile or delete your account. It's a data miner with no benefits.;
Nice;
"It was great for like three days until my feed became 99% accounts I don't follow or care to see. Like another reviewer said, it's mostly blue check accounts (celebrities or Instagram ""models"") that I don't want to see instead of accounts I actually follow. Mix in a ton of spammy ""grow your threads"" posts from bots and that's the current experience. I think I spent most of my time on the app the last two days muting and blocking accounts but at this point I give up.";
Super;
This app is very 😍 amazing;
❤️❤️❤️;
I prefer to use twitter;
This is what Twitter wanted to be until they changed their management and ruined it by letting rampant hate. Longer posts, simple engagement, just better Twitter. It just needs to continue to add things like video, gifs and such. Happy with it. Happy to have SWITCHED to it.;
Ok;
So why do we need this aap if there is another like this;
Oh my god 🤣🤣🤣 damn it.... Twitter and threads like to same of lag performance...hmm not interested by threads;
Pelan pelan mark;
It's a good app. Mark, do more on this;
Twitter copy that isn't as good, No thanks !!!;
Boring walls of text from people I've never heard of. The app has no apparent purpose. Uninstalled.;
Excellent work;
Hundred millions times better than other competitor app.;
Smarter;
No funciona en mi teléfono. Abro sesión y aparece una pantalla toda distorsionada. No se puede leer nada ni identificar ningún botón. No puedo hacer absolutamente nada. Nota: Con la última actualización el problema se solucionó y por eso mi nota paso de 1 estrella a 5 estrellas.;
Update this spp;
facebook;
Wonderful experience;
Twitter is way better;
Is this only for Instagram users? Should user have to create account insta, and then have to use this app.;
Please you need to add DM and some Joint Group or gathering club for internation with other user to promote peace and love;
Great app;
I am not giving away access to everything;
GREAT APP;
Crashes every time I try and leave a comment, so frustrating to use;
Good app so far I have used it for 10 hours it's amazing a few things to be included in future update like messaging, tagging in photos.;
Great app;
very bad imitation of Twitter;
Another phenomenal socmed platform by Meta! I just downloaded this yesterday and I am already comfortable with using it. The user interface is super easy to learn and get used to. Plus, the features are superb. You can literally upload Threads in one click. Furthermore, you can also reply to other people's post with text, image, and other interactions. They're all visible in one place, unlike to the other confusing and dizzying platform called Twitter. <3 LOL;
Better than Twitter;
I wrote down words and tried to correct for wrong spelling or error in words. After I pressed delete or backwards button, I could no longer write any more words. I had to discard the current thread and tried to write a new thread. In the new one, the error was gone until I pressed delete text button. FYI, It happened in Andriod mobile app when I first wanted to post a new thread. I want you to fix this bug very soon.;
Something wrong. Not working properly;
Threads they Censor free speech threads is communist Tweter is much better freedom of speech.;
Elon Musk Crying 😢 in Corner 😅;
Supar;
Trash;
Doesn't get past the terms and conditions, just sits there loading.;
The fascist Alt-Left woke liberal losers control this platform with massive censorship against Trump Supporters & Conservatives with zero freedom of speech so screw you;
Copies are copies;
Just Zuck ripping off another social media network. Has he ever come up with anything in his own? It's just a Twitter ripoff with ten time the censorship, ten times the big brother, ten times the salty tears of Twitter.;
Bekar hai bhaiya Mai toh Tut Gaya😭;

I love this;
Has a lot of potential, but your newsfeed is literally ONLY people you don't follow. It's all just really cringe memes and 2012 tumblr-eqsue jokes. Absolutely unusable at time of writing, and will be until you can view content that you've actually opted to see. Idk why it was released in such a state.;
Dirty tricks;
As good as the Wi-Fi world we live in has to offer.;
Worst.....;
kiri😍😍😍😍😍😍;
সামিম;
Excellent app instgram;
"Not only is it an incomplete, glitchy app. It broke my Instagram app. After deleting my threads account and uninstalling. My Instagram still has the threads badge on my bio. No matter how many times I press ""remove badge"" to temporarily remove it, the moment I refresh my insta page the badge is back on my bio. Meta is using my bio to advertise this app. I have expressed I hate it by uninstalling it and deleting my account it's disingenuous. Shouldn't my data be deleted? Why is there a badge";
great app and it’s pretty decent. however, it would be great if we got to change our usernames and names that is not in lined with instagram.;
The posts in here are the most mundane, vapid junk I've ever seen. It seriously feels as if AI is making all the posts. On top of that there's no way to refresh the main (and only!!) Feed with new content. You are stuck with the same feed throughout the day, which only incrementally gets new content added to it as the day goes on.;
This application will provide the information on the program;
The app is great and I like I can connect to my favourite celebrity's. However since I downloading and installing threads my instagram has been hack into 4 times which I had to reset my password. Would love to keep but for my security reasons I'm having to delete the app. Sucks too because I loved it.;
I love you insta;
I barely opened the account and I already started receiving spam messages. It is so plain. You can't customize it. It doesn't even show much besides the things that you are not interested in. This app sucks.;
Twitter copy paste, but worse;
👎;
Bakwas;
Unhide option enable 😶;
It's need improvement as It is very slow to check followers and it takes very much time to upload image or video and don't show percentage of upload in notication in ui;
Twitter is way better than this.. F u 🦎;
AJ;
Threads is USELESS to me unless I can have it on my Computer at home;
Good development;
It's good 👍nice☺️☺️;
Far from twitter.;
Copy and paste from Twitter!!! Present something new, what else is this?!;
Worst app;
o wow threads;
❤️❤️❤️;
A Sad excuse for Twitter;
Good;
I am not using Instagram 😭;
Mast hai;
I am glad you that you offer us this application I'm thankful to you ❤️;
Worst app,twitter is better with freedom of speech without cancellation;

Not good app growing are not post;

Thread ini asik, tapi kejelekan utamanya adalah saya harus baca tulisan2 makhluk2 centang biru yg ndak penting, kenapa juga mereka muncul dan menutupi tulisan2 teman2 saya? Capek me-mute mereka satu2;
Fabulous app 🔥🔥🔥;
Good app;
Am I really the first one to review (even after 1M downloads);
Elon Musk Zindabad;

i just love it;
İt's ok. Lacks tons of features. Like chronological feed, search for topics translate;
I'm not a Twitter fan, but this one is Not even close to twitter 😒😶;
Basic Twitter clone. All the hub bub is that . Apparently if still you want the experience, Twit is where you should be;
Zuck has destroyed real social life.;
It's a rip off , that's it;
Very good app for social worker 👍;
Nice app overall aap campare to Socialsite . I want to Say that all people download app and share your videos and pics .Threads to promote Name,fam and money;
Just used one day of it and the next day always prompt I've been logged out and the owner might change password. Well, it's connected with my IG and never changed password though.;
Stop showing others people i didn't follow, If I wanna see them I'll search them myself. It's annoying;
I dislike the total lack of control over what appears in my feed. Things I have NO interest in and have never appeared on IG fill my feed to the exclusion of my real interests. There's no ability filter by followings. .;
Good app;
Me genera un problema que me saca de la aplicacion cada vez que quiero escribir algo.;
Terrible ui, buggy , slow,;
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟💞💞♥️♥️♥️💗💗💗🥰🥰😘😘😘;
Super app;
Wannabe Twitter But Trash.. You will have no control of feed. They collect all your personal information including your banking. You will be censored if you speak facts and go against the script;
Can't open app it doesen't allow me to enter.;
Very bad experience 😑;
I am love it;
I installed this app and tried to open it..it's just blank and nothing is loading;
Ouu;
It has to have a message translator in it.;
Pretty bad;
Good app;
Nice work;
Its got a lot of potential. Creating a post is still a bit basic cuz i can only attach from my gallery. I cant use my camera for impromtu things.;
Worst app;
I really like it;
Better than Twitter 😂💕;
Interesting 🤔;
Nic;
Very usefull 👍💥;
Good;
Great app when i see it at the time i delete twitter ❤;
Timeline full of worthless celebrity and brand spam.;
This app is so much better than twitter Thanks Zucker berg;
Great start for a positive space. Like many reviews so far there are things to add to the app to make it better. The search page is a bit bland maybe more like insta? A visual thing. Trending would be good on there too. And instead of the usual drab news stories why not the best most positive news stories circulating. The no ads is a winner for me though that will probably change. I have to say it is a breath of fresh air so far. But it needs to stay a positive place.;
Vary nice app🥰🥰;
so beautiful apps;
OMG THEY COPIED INSTA AND TWITTER. UNINSTALLED!;
This app is god;
Reviews I am out 3 in S8;

Good 😊😊👍;
When i was follow someone after refresh it automatically unfollow but show in my profile that you was follow him;
It's alright but the scroll behaviour pisses me off. Stop restricting the scroll speed, it makes the app so annoying to scroll down and makes me leave faster.;
Need a reel features 🌬️🌼;
This is not opening;
Is nice;
Copyright infringement;
Dicker app;
I love this app;
Why I can not change my display name..!?;
Awesome app;
Not willing to share so much permissions for this app.;
It quite terrible in my opinion...it missed so much details that tweeter has, as it they made it just for clout.;
Best app;
Nice;
Copy and paste;
Great app but GIFs I upload are not displaying correctly 99% of the time.;
Super;
Nice app.;
Great app. But if they have a black mode and PIN/Highlights post it's will be much better because why not 🤔 Anyway, this app more easier n friendly user. It's also aesthetic (for me 😃).;
A lot better than Twitter;
Blud where is the trending page;
Still needs some features but so far this is the most relaxed social media platform.;
Great app really good but still needs some more features to be added going forward;
Looks awful and the timeline is seems like an ad fest, with all the verified brands tweeting;

Needs more ways to login, ONLY FOR INSTAGRAM USERS;
Excellent;
This cheap knock-off suck! I'm going back to Twitter.;
Really garbage;
The worst app I have ever experienced.. Despite providing correct log in details this app is showing incorrect password...I am utterly shocked having experienced this from a reputable and top company like meta.;
Nice👍;
I m facing some lag on threads I think it will be fix by the threads devloper team And i cannot like threads by double tap I think it will fix or help full suggestion for ur team thank you;
I'm no bot. App is horrible. And as I heard, I posted right away and was censored, everyone was right.;
Please hurry to finish the Threads program for the desktop, because it will be more beautiful to use on the computer;
Elon musk supporter 😎;
i think its a good app, does need work like any other app obviously but we should be able to delete our accounts without having to delete our instagrams if we have it linked it, especially to those who didnt know that rule or didnt read about it (like me);
I love it;
Omg;
Leterally you have no use of it.... I assure you that.;
Wow nice 👍;
it's very good useful thing 👆;
The best place to be 🔥;
Nice app;
My thread id is not visible in my instagram account Really a waste app;
Useless app...;
Nthing special;
There could be potential here, but for now it seems like a very poorly optimized twitter;
unable to login, error threads.;
This app requires near criminal levels of data collection and oppressive permissions to your devices. If you value your privacy at all, delete it immediately.;
Too much bugs. Please fix some bugs first. For example, when I click the delete button for fixing the word/line, all the other words will mix/collide and create some never ever known word.;
They are collecting all of your data, and recording through your cameras then selling it to the highest bidder;
I'm one that I didn't hate or love Twitter. But I thought I would try this out like the other social apps recently. And Threads has it right it's easy to use and I like that you can just use all of you just snyc all of your IG followers. They have that info anyway. The only thing is there's not very much socializing Yet.;
Nice app;
I just really want u to delete this platform or whatever it is !! It's just too distracting!! Instagram is a good platform tho u must delete this platform (threads app ). It'll be really really helpful!!!;
I'd;
Long live twitter🐦;
Cheap copy of twitter;
🥲;
Good Application😍;
Unstructured random drivel;
Nice appe;
Aap is not downloading;
Mr. Musk, we don't expect it.;
تطبيق رائع فعلاً;
I'm on here but not happy about the E.U. banning this platform. The fact that it's accused of data mining is disturbing. I'll keep it disabled until I get more information about what Zuckerberg is up to. I don't like the fact that all I see are profiles with Blue badges. Famous people with a lot of likes and comments but a regular Joe has barely 10 followers and no interactions. If this is it Twitter has nothing to worry about.;
Super 👍;
Superb app;
Good;
Embrace, extend, extinguish. Ditch Elon Musk or Zuckerberg and to for the open source alternatives such as Mastodon.;
Excellent;
Don't use Instagram ergo it's worthless.;
❤️❤️;
Copy of Twitter;

Twitter clone, copy and paste, shame on Mark, he could come with new and smart ideas, zero star;
Got potential for sure. Easy to block Nazis and bigots, unlike Twitter. Room for improvement on usability;
Princekumar;
I don't use Instagram, and this app only allows Instagram users to sign in. But I just don't want to create an Instagram account to use threads. 😕;
Basically Twitter with censorship.;
better than twitter;
This app is so osm for more information about my knowledge 🫡👍 & very easy to login 🥳🥳👏👏 too good;
Bad;
So far so good;
Toooo much content;
1k followers please help me🙏🙏🙏;
I don't see the point of this app. Like a boring version of the boring Facebook and Twitter apps;
Trying to steal all our info? NO THANKS!;
Like twitter but with less bots, less creeps, less nazis, less scams, less pdf files.;
Nice;
i like it I think it will be very good if it adds the ability to categorize the threads.;
Great app worth downloading;
super bete;
This app is so cool;
worst app ever made;
There is no Modi ji in this aap🙁;
Very good apps;
🤑♥️;
I installed this app and my threads account login it's just showing as a @ I can't even edit that.. disappointed;
BEST OF LUCK 🤞;
Absolute Copy of Twitter;
👍;
Twitter copy with more censorship.;
Good app;
Copy technology;
Nice;
It would be perfect if they will add trending feature like tweeter;
Crashes alot and as a Twitter dupe!/alternative so many features are missing like lista, seeing your followers and following quickly, crashes, just a lot to be asked of;
💫;
Mark Zuckerberg is the best in his game;
It is good app but should have some more features;
Very boring app just to waste your precious time of minutes / hours.;
would be cool if I could only see posts from people I follow instead of the cesspit of that is narcissistic people that swear we care about the things they have to say;
Good;
Cool app;
Bad app because comment option off I don't give reply anyone in my post 😩🥵;
1 star for Mark trying to steal even more of our data. Boo FB Meta WhatsApp Insta Threads. You may aswell start a phone network;
Anybody that trusts Mark will get what they deserve.;
An alternative to twitter to stop free speech;
Cannot open the app......check the glitch;
Alot of bugs.;
It is confusing and hard to navigate;
A copy of twitter with worse user experience;
Threads is a junk application;
RIP privacy;
Being a first-week user, I've experienced improvement and better stability in just 10 days. Features are hearty at launch, learning curve is very low. Not pornified, no crypto bro or tabloid ad bombs (yet). Very stoked for Threads.;
Nice;
Meh;
Sigh... it's boring but it will eventually get better in the future.;
Can't take the badge off my profile. Can't delete thread account without deleting my IG..;
Don't find easy;
i found it annoying that if i delete my threads account, my instagram account gets deleted too;
I totally hate this app, this app censor every single thing you say. Hello I am so going back to Twitter I have a voice and Zuckerberg you can keep your censored app. Read all the t's & c's people. WAKE THE HELL UP PEOPLE!!;
Good;
Not to shabby for a start, but it lacks features. I also don't like how it collects data and the fact you can't delete your threads account without deleting your Instagram account. I'm sticking with Twitter until they can figure it out.;
Good;
Necesita una sección en donde uno vea solamente las cuentas que sigues... lo necesita urgente;
Created by a hypocrite who censors and is known to collect and sell your data;
This Is A Very Help Ful App It Just Needs A Live Button To Go Live And It Needs To Allow Users For The Following Cause The Following Needs To Adjust To Working So That Other Users Get To See The Following On The List And It's Some Thing Like Twitter.;
I love it;
Zuckerberg, you're a genius)) so Mask get around));
😂;
"A welcome option to get away from Twitter, but migration, though painless, comes without a few much needed aspects. Searching by keywords for posts about a subject can't be done. No option to see trending subjects either. And the app does not always keep its last position, resulting sometimes in restarting from the very beginning of your feed. The recent update fixed the jerky scrolling; everything else is pending more updates!";
Wow very amazing app Love him 😘😘;
Failed application;
They sell my data;
Wish version of Twitter and with censorship. Get Twitter =Free Speech;
Best app ever;
The app is amazing and has simple features unlike Twitter where newbies finds it difficult to use. Congratulations to the Meta team for this fantastic and extraordinary 'INSTA TWITTER'!!;
I dont use social media a lot and wasn't planning on using Threads at all. I just look at my homescreen and it was installed on my phone. I have absolutely no idea how it got on my phone but I have now uninstalled this app and Instagram;
Accha visit ha;
Good;
📝💯🧡best.;
Their is an only one option for login that is Instagram but their is many Facebook user can also try this app and i think that most of facebook user are older there is and some probability they don't have an insta ac if we provide the login with Facebook then uts help.. (We can not avoid some minorities may be this can help us in future);
I would love to be able to post to Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, all at once.;
I love it...it’s easy to use Love YOU Mark Zuckerberg for this you're a sweet man i have ever seen we can connect each other using new technology you're superb man Love From laksam,Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩;

I will give 5 stars when the user could save the post and video in gallery directly;
Too much censorship;
It's basically a worse version of twitter;
Good app;
L app Twiter is better;
Uninstalled due to being forced into having to make a Facebook account just to make Instagram account just to make a threads account.. stupid! Shouldn't need all that unnecessary rubbish! The app should be it's own separate thing.. not having to sign in by using another apps..;
Bland app design, nothing new to do with the app. Ctrl c, Ctrl v for no reason at all.;
Wow;
Great job..Mark Zuckerberg and his crew;
Only want to see people I follow and not everyone else's feed. That's part of the reason I don't like Instagram as much as I use to. I don't like being forced to have other people's post show up on my feed when I'm trying to see what my friends and family are up to.;
Better than TWITTER;
Not bad but still needs a ton of improvement. For example fixing the timeline.;
The feed algorithm is hell on earth. No features. Pointless and will die in a few months. Was really hoping it would be good and save us from Elon;
It takes a lot of effort to open it;
Needs some polishing up but already nicer than Twitter.;
Copy;
Fix the gifs. Its coming out green and purple!;
Good;
It's good;
Dumped Twitter..Love Threads;
Hastags doesn't work, what about trending topics?;
Please enable us to edit the post we've made. Thx 😊;
very difficult UI;
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤;
Cópia do Twitter sem privacidade;
invasion of privacy;
Agree with you;
Twitter for tankies;
Most Useless app;
I can't login to threads . Horrible experience;
Installed threads then found myself banned from commenting for one week. No help from meta even when reporting a problem. Stick to twitter folks. The REAL freedom. ✌️👌;
It needs a lot of work. It constantly crashes, to the point where I can barely use it. It isn't auto-following everyone I follow on insta. I can't search for terms, which lead me to a topic I'm interested in and the layout feels quite lacking. It needs some sort of visual flare: animations, pops of colour, page transitions, etc... just something to make it all feel pleasing and tie it into a great package.;
Needs a TON of work, but I will hold out hope. There is no real search. No GIF keyboard. Some glaring bugs. Definitely released early, but with that in mind, it is quite smooth for what it does.;
Copied...;
Still got more work to do to beat Twitter;
So why can't I see the number of people that I am following? Why am I being shown all of these pages that I do not follow?;
Why zuck;
Amazing apps for me;
I tried to make an Instagram account of my normal email, nothing unusual and my account was banned before I could even log on. Now it wants my phone number and a selfie. I think I'll just use a different app that doesn't require such sensitive info just to try it out. Thanks but no thanks.;
PLEASE add hashtags, I hate getting stuff unrelated on my feed, I need hashtags to follow accounts with similar tastes as me.;
Nice app;
Beautiful;
Random feed sucks. It makes the experience awful and the social app loses its purpose. Terrible experience.;
Bad;
Will not recommend. Its just a cheap version of Twitter.;
The simple fact that it sabotages that egomaniac elon is a plus. 5 stars from me;
Good app;
Nice app;
I'm having a hard time certain threads videos on the app. No volume as soon as I push the little speaker it freezes.;
Pretty Solid App. Wish it didn't show me threads from people I don't follow, and an easier way to find people and subjects through searching. Very fun and simple to use. Surprisingly well managed and appropriate.;
At first, I used this app, everything was okay. But, yesterday, when I wanted to open my account, it said that someone had logged out my account and said that maybe the owner had changed the password. I never logged out and changed the password. Hope you have a solution to this issue. I don't want to lose my Instagram account because of this.;
Censored free speach app;
Twitter 😎;
Being forced to have an instagram account;
I installed it because I don't like musk that much lol;
I don't like it, less features, please update;
Awful i would never support the zuck this is trying to beat elon and we all know zuck is in the govts back pocket and elon is on the peoples side so if your for the constitution dont use this app!!;
All the best;
Twitter Wannabe. Please, at least provide something different. This is just a cheap copy of Twitter. Elon does it better. It's too funny that Meta is actually just copy pasting Twitter. Cheap copy. Weak. Useless. Nothing new. Where are the new innovative ideas. Boring and childish behaviour from a huge company just copy pasting another companies ideas. Laughable 3 thumbs down 👎;
Most of my feed is people I'm not even following...;
LOVELY;
"Ik this app just started but theres some basic functions that are missing. for example ""add account"" for people like me who has 2 accounts. I hate logging out and logging in and my personal has 2 fact on so i always have to wait for auth on my ig app to log in.";
Your aap sad is;
"Not a fan that the only sign-up option is to use an Instagram account, instead of letting you choose to a Meta account. Funny considering it says very clearly at the bottom ""from Meta"".";
It's very good 💝;
Ratio;
Nice 👍🙂;
Wrost app ever;
Junk;
Good 😊;
Not joining this garbage. 1 because you cannot make Instagram function properly starting at basic commenting on posts! 2, this is a money grab. F you tech billionaires. You don't need more money!;
Just joined it but looks like nice and smoothly working AAP but still lot to done on this AAP.;
Sameer;
Nice app;
Another half baked app. Why do companies keep doing this? The clowns that made PokemonGo did it first and here we are again. You can't fix a bad first impression and y'all are mad goofy for releasing this pile of rubbish. Twitter is bad, but this is just pathetic. I've seen high schoolers put in more effort. Downloaded and deleted.;
Dont download if you will delete threads app it will delete your all instagram data ypur ig profile will be dismissed;
Please show in unhide badge in Instagram app;
I can't even log in. I can't use the app.;
Easy and impressive;
Going on❣️❣️❣️;
Bahut bathiya Hai ye bevshay ak bar jarur dekhe;
One of the wrost software, I have ever been used. After installing and use my Instagram profile & Facebook profile was hacked and compromised. Generally I requested all of you don't use this application. One more thing if you install it you can't withdraw from your Instagram account. One of the failure application of Meta.;
Nice;
I would give this zero stars if that was possible. It's like Twitter from wish and threads doesn't allow free speech and is heavily censored. Shame on meta for even coming up with the idea to copy Twitter.;
बकवास 🤢🤢;
Garbage app. You'll never be good at anything copying someone else. How's that 1 billion a month going with the metaverse? 😂😂😂 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️;
First man 5⭐start #nicethreads;
For the devs, here are pointers on how you can improve the app: 1. Allow users to save pictures. 2. Only censor porn on profiles below 18. 3. Have a translation feature. 4. Do not repeat the same mistake as Twitter where accounts that the users aren't following are appearing on their feed. If y'all just wanna make a Twitter ripoff, at least make it a better version from the very start.;
It's good, but i prefer and would use Twitter anyday, honestly.;
So much spam. I go to a popular post and 70% of the replies are people saying to do 'x' for $5,000 or proving links. It's a ton of spam and bots at the moment. Makes me sadly go back to Twitter for now.;
Need more work.;
Very confusing user interface. Looks like the cheap copy of Twitter.;
Very useful;
Good;
Imitação do twitter só que ruim.;
Oh.. this one..is it from Facebook..or Meta....is it first company that was baned. Full of copy paste...;
Basically Twitter with censorship.;
It's disorganized and u can't even see posts from who u follow on ur feed. Also theirs no way to filter content on ur feed. The mute and block r ok buts it needs more filter options.if I could I'd give it 0 stars;
Excellent so far! Really enjoying it. Looking forward to upcoming updates and meaningful conversations!;
This is a very good application. Will there be any monetization tools on this too;
Monuking;
Requires Instagram to create an account. No thank you.;
In this application very bugs and glitches 😞😞😞😞;
Great app. Downside : I want curate my home be to be able to only see the content of the people follow my friends. As opposed to what's trending from a bunch of people I don't know.;
Copied twitter;

Will never use Instagram. No other way to login here 😕??;
I like the threads app for meta, but I am concerned it could share the wrong data. Is there a way to make sure it doesn't leak any secure data, gps info, or location to that closed social media site, Mastodon. This way I and anyone else with a Instagram account can be comfortable using it alone side Instagram for fashion, photography, and gaming? I want to give it a try, but that social media site made me uncertain if I should use it. Thank You.;

No way to create account rather than Instagram login.;

Monopolisation of social media channels is not good for humanity.;
Very Good app 👍🏻;
Totally a copy of twitter.;
First few days it worked well and now it doesn't load at all. I've tried reinstalling and clearing cache etc without any luck.;

Can't zoom or download the image, suck Zuckerberg;
Nothing about this app feels good. No novel features upon launch, no way to make money on the app, just feels like a copy and paste Twitter with the most random algorithm ever.;
😎😎;
I love this app;
जुके दाजुले twitter को कपी गर्न खोजेको हा तर मलाई चाहिँ खासै गतिलो लागेन 😂😂😂😂;
Delet this pls;

Just amazing apps 😍😍;
A social media where you cant see the people you FOLLOW on the main timeline is an abysmal idea, this thing doesn't even have a DM function.;
I can't upload any photo or to give my personal thread chat the will just close itself;
Copy paste App;
After installing this app I can't change my Instagram chat themes I can't call anyone I can't see photos This is a wrost application don't waste ur net and time 🤬;

This app the not have chatting;
No photo developers understand;
An amazing start, I wish this app be totally open, but I can sense that there will be a tone regulations comings which is why Twitter is so far ahead, you can literally find anything there, I hope they turn this app into a place for cute msgs and etc. Zuck should definitely make this into the real town square that Elon failed to accomplish.;

Not Good,;

"The cookie is still in the oven, but you're impatient and want it now. Cons: Videos not playing after unmuting. No hashtags. Feed is too random and crowded. Needs a following tab. Lots of ""account growth"" spam. No alt text. Pros: Blocking, and muting does the job. UI is clean. Harassment is manageable. Not owned by Elon. It's not Twitter.";
Nice app same like tiwtter;
Sorry but after installation and reading the terms... i thought that i am totally against centralization. I prefer #NOSTR a decentralized protocol for social media. RIP meta....;
"Ok, so again algorithm is going to feed you with all sorts of garbage. Make the ""see people you follow only"" mode.";
Cheap copy;
perfect;
I hate it.;
"So far the app is good. I'm loving it. So addictig. But I request, put some ""see translation"" like what you did on Instagram. :))";
U can;
Goooooodddddd;
Better then Twitter 😅;
It's better than twitter;
It is just like Twitter and same as Instagram but it is a good app. I love it.;
Nice app;
Show the stuff that I'm following and lass to none of the stuff I'm not following.;
Nice app;
Beautiful;
Good 😊😊;

Fabulous App 👌;
This feels like a knock off Twitter;
Aman;
This is the best app for online calling. I experienced this app and it's easy to use....;
Less toxic and more friendly than the blue bird app. It's still a work in progress, but it doesn't feed me divisive content just to get engagement.;
The app's concept is great, but it's full of glitches! Whenever the content in the display changes, the full app becomes glitchy. Even on a small scroll, the problem appears. Let alone some button clicking! Maybe the issue is only applicable for a few type of users. But, please fix the bug. In spite of this app's being great, I have to stay neutral by giving 2 stars is just because of these bugs.;
Very good 👍👍👍;
Nothing much as expected;
Yes it's nice app;

This app is slow. Like very slow. Twitter is much faster than this;
Good app but my pics 1 day ago and my pics is not viral why?;
Good;

Unable to delete account without deleting Instagram. Pathetic attempt to get more users;
Please move the post button to the top. My keyboard covers the button up on screen and maybe make the icons bigger or darker so we can see the functions better.;
I can't seem to download it. Tch;
Stop copying others apps.;
Well;
This is a very good app that deserves a lot of appreciation;
Good apps;
The app was perfect good for everything Twitter s**ks let's go but it's much better without eu countries I don't wanna see there Twitter bias here;
I like it;
It's just a cheap copy of Twitter;
Can you remove all the people I don't follow on my feed. I'd love to see people who I follow. Thank you!!!;
Wast aap wold in not 🚫 seen this aap ,🤮🤮;
Meh;
Good 👍;
I changed my insta password and now threads won't let me even open the app, let alone a login screen or anything;
Cheap copy and we all know;
How it's login without Instragram & If I forget my Instragram password;
Cheap copy of twiiter;

Not Like Twitter, not even closer to it. You should bring something different from Twitter. It feels like we are using a copy.;
It is not a good aap for 12+;

Woww;
Pretty terrible. An empty space for cold brands to just be cringy. There's no heart or community. This is plainly a rip off of Twitter and should be banned for plagiarism in all honesty.;
just a baloon;
Its fine. Does it function? Yes. Is it a good social media platform? Absolutely not. The only people who ever pop up on the home page are people you followed from instagram or meme pages you have 0 interest in that only ever post about threads. Theres no algorithm to help you find new accounts you might like. If you're a small creator you'll get 1 like from someone who follows you on instagram and then your post gets buries. Dont bother;
lol I get bug although I restart or also restart phone it keeps it problem;
It's a good app but no right to free speech in the app;
90% of my home feed is ads or blue-check-marks posting trash I don't want to see or people I don't care about. For some reason, the other 10% is Spanish and I don't even speak Spanish!!?? I scrolled through today for 10 minutes and didn't see a SINGLE ACCOUNT I FOLLOWED.;
This App is wonderful apps ❤️😊;
Garbage. It's awfull;
🫀🫀🫀🫀🫀🫀🫀;

Horrible algorithm for feed, shows just randomly anything. Makes no sense at all.;

This is very good app. I like this..;
Cannot post anything or see replies to threads posted by others. Uninstalled an reinstalled. Nothing.;

There already recommending all the Celebrities, Politics, and Sports I've already blocked on IG, I literally don't indulge in any of this nonsense. Nice try re-Twitter Uninstalled and flagged (top right) for impersonating an already garbage app full of propaganda Karen's and far left extreme weirdos;
4 stars for the whole application but can you put a button for save pictures it's hard to save a picture from the app. Thank you.;
Provide edit function. I just committed a type. I want to get it rectified. Please provide edit functionality for a min or two so that I can do it.;
Does not work! I can only watch feed. I cannot post anything or comment. I cannot see comments at all;
Spyware;
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕;
not well;
ดีเยี่ยม;
Literally just Instagram and twitter merged Nothing extra In fact would even say its worse than twitter, twitter shows likes replies etc. With an icon and a number in a much cleaner way Also once you sync your Instagram and threads u MUST have the same handle on both? Also there are still bots....;
How is this a twitter killer? Do we need this, really??? It's worse and doesn't pay content creators like twitter does.;
Irrelevant since twitter is much more mature and protects free speech;
Twitter copy;
ui keeps glitching out;
🍀;
looking forward to the app's improvements :));
Beautiful apps;
friendly app;
"It's great, but there's a lot of QoL that can be done. Like putting the ""Publish"" button at the top of the post menu. Also, there is a bug where when you mention someone, if you type two letters of their name before the suggestions appear, the app crashes. I think the app has potential, but it needs some polishing. Also, I wish there was an option to create an account from scratch instead of importing an Instagram account.";
Bad app;
Upgraded to 5 star cause meta team heard my complaint as soon as I reported it. the bug I've experienced earlier before the update was fixed already and I can use the app now normally no matter what the theme is. however, it looks like the update was only intend to fix the bug issue + performance improvement and nothing more. anyway, the app looks nicer now and smooth after the update but, surprised to see how rapid the ratings of the app recede in a couple of days after the launch.;
Threads works fine like Twitter. Easy adding friends from Instagram.;
Can't see comments, profile sections. Constantly seeing something went wrong try again later. This is happening for the last 3-4 days.;
Not a good app as compared to Twitter;
It's new really good app 😀 but Elon musk, Twitter master copy😹just for fun .❤️ love app❤️;
"Not sure why this is but I'm having issues opening the app now, getting an error ""invalid parameters"" and I have no idea why, can someone help?";

خوبه ولی خیلی صفحه ش مبتدی طراحی شده باید ارتقا بدید ش تا جذابیت بیشتری داشته باشه خفه بنظر می رسه جدابیت اینستا رو نداره;
Boring aap👎👎;
Threads is such a breath of fresh air! It's far more civil, friendly and doesn't (to date) stoke outrage. Love the fact that I've communicated with people as diverse as Jim Comey, Jodi Piccoult and Tom Brady. Of course there will be growing pains. In my humble opinion, Zuck has won the cage match!!;
Cheap copy;
"It's a good app with a lot of potential, but for some reason I haven't been able to see my notifications or people's profiles (mine included!) since yesterday as it says ""something went wrong"".";

Meta is still Facebook, threads will forever be unhealthy, and leave you seeking negative attention. Fk the zuck.;
Does exactly what it's supposed to, not for me though;
Doesn't work anymore;
Supar;
Way better than Twitter;
It is good but some more improvements can be made. If you give some new updates then it will be more fun to use. Us and this is a great app. If you give the feature of chatting in this too, then there will be a little more fun in chatting.;
yo threads is way more better than twitter #zuku brother is the best #mark zukerburgez;
Can't use unless you have Instagram account,;
It is not working in Russia 🇷🇺;

Twitter copy. Stop copying your competitors;
The app is overall good. But we can't make two accounts. Means on insta we can login two accounts. But on threads, I can't login another account.;

Poorly done app, and once you realize it's bad, you can't even delete it without deleting your whole instagram account. Strongly recommend to not get this app;

UX can improve. Scrolling isn't smooth and lags. The flood of followers gained by the follow all option is not the best.;
Good;
Major features are missing - 1. No hashtags 2. Search only brings back accounts to follow...it should show relevant posts. 3. No trending;

Wasn't it right that threads would have been a separate platform, I mean login from Instagram because there are many flaws like you can edit account in threads, privacy, change username and many things that change Instagram We want threads to be a separate platform. If I want to link, that is a different matter;
I accidentally linked my account to it but sadly i can't delete my threads account without deleting my instagram account. Such a trashh app;
So nice 👍👍👍;
Hello sir good morning please solve my threads ka option remove ho gya solve my problem;
NICE APP;
Good 😊😊👍;
Nice👍;
Garbage;
I support Elon Musk & Twiterr 😑;
👍👍;
Dumb;
This app Nise;
Mark zuckerburg is good. Boy👌👌;
Growth and development socially connected in a good way!;
Hail Twitter ❤️;
I can't believe Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are fighting for a app like this;
Good;
Gurunath;
It's just better than the birds 😜;
Can I get this on my desktop PC?;
❣️;
Can't upload videos with photos lately!!! Buggy!!!!;
I don't know how this work;
Lacks a lot of features so here's some feedback: Add a trending page in there. Make it so that the followers and following can be accessed separately, like on IG. Allow people to have different usernames from their IG handles. When there's a bunch of images, show them in a collage instead of showing one big image and then scrolling to the others like in IG. Also, let people zoom into pics without the images resizing themselves automatically. Don't compress images. Make it different from IG.;
Worst app if I delete it due to some reasons it will delete my original account on Instagram 📷;
Useless;
Why should I delete insta account to delete threads;
Love it 🤍;
Bad;
Uninstalled the same day as installing it. This is just another addition to the ultra-intrusive suite of applications from Meta. There's no way this garbage is even touching the feathers of Twitter.;
Good;
Cool;
I dunno what happened but can you bring back my account?? like fr my threads suddenly got disabled and now even my Instagram account was disabled.. seriously I shouldn't have downloaded this app if I know what's gonna happen;
MaZaa to Aa rHa hai halka halka.🤟;
I realize the app is in its infancy, but this thing is really inconvenient. I can only use the app from my phone to post. I can't use it on my laptop at all, not even taking something from my Instagram page and crossposting. Please fix this. Allow us to post from devices other than just phones. I have failing eyesight and this becomes a real problem for me because my phone screen (and anything I write using it) is so small.;
Good;
Really this is a good app 🤩 We always get good facilities from Twitter 🙂;
It’s cool;
Nice 👍;
So nice app;
Terrible app. Copy cat of Twitter, and has terrible user experience.;
Copy cat;
Awesome fetures app;
This very nice 👌 👍;
Love this app 💓🫶;
Amazing fabulous 😍;
The app is 99% copy of Twitter 🤣;
User experience is amazing but lots of things have update;
Good app i like it so so much;
I will give this app 5 star nice app from meta good work;
Worst app;
Need add more feature;
They deleted my account because I said this won't compete with twitter. It won't! Get better not bitter!!;
Nice app 1.m followers please please please please please;
💩💩☕ copy of Twitter 😅😂💩;
You can't delete Threads without deleting your entire instagram account. Gross. So I'm deleting both! Byeee!;
Good;
Good;
It's too good 👍 app;
Working like a bug , just after logged in the screen starts flickering;
Tamu;
My favourite but I want a blue tick please;
It's is like mini Twitter which is launched by Instagram;
❤️❤️;
я просто не могу зайти в приложение. отвратительно.;
Sukanta kumar;
Sabse bekar aap;
it's a really nice app accept if I were to delete the app instagram account would get deleted personally I don't think that's a really good thing;
A very bad application first, because I hate a person called Mark, secondly, because he is a literal imitation of Twitter;
Twitter > Threads;
Wasn't able to open the app after download;
Very good 👍🏻;
Very similar to Instagram and Facebook can't beat twitter I think who will download the app is the same of people who have Instagram and Facebook only;
Pathetic and the most confusing app.;
Better than the blue bird;
Copy;
Doesn't have dark mode on android...the basic feature nowadays. Cannot open Help Centre. Terrible. Plz bring dark mode then i might start using it.;
Copyright Infringement Left unchecked;
I only prefer Twitter but include with insta no chance ever man fuc u zukku 🐼👂;
Good working than Twitter;
Boring app Twitter is far better than this.;
landscape problem;
Sucks;
Worse don't install;
Nice;
"Los videos se pausan cuando presionas el botón de ""unmute"" y por ende no es posible escuchar el audio.";
timepass application can't compete with twitter.;
First copy of twitter with better user experience.;
Nice aap;
Only time vest 🤦😡;
"App is good when it works. Recently, all my posts have been getting an error message saying ""failed to upload""";
It has best features but when upload speed is very low.;
It's a collection of your personal information which is sold to anyone who wants your info. They can use it to sell to China and other people who'll use it to harm you and your family;
Ultimate;
It's applications are very poor it's looking like 🐦 twitter not a new platform;
annasir24;
NOT open social network as claimed. Even when it finally implements ActivityPub, still not 'open'. It's a scam.;
U shud add some interesting features in this app which no other app have....jus like liking pic showers hearts n some other kind of interesting stuff....;
Nice;
Good;
I don't like mark mama;
Too slow to use;
What's the point of having the offensive filter on when the filters can't even block posts that contain obviously misogynistic language?;
Nic threads;
Vary good threads apps..;
I don't want to have an Instagram account in order to use this.;
The app has been good so far, just a little inconvenience today, I couldn't upload a photo and I couldn't see my followers, kindly look into that, awesome job so far.;
Having trouble setting up/managing multiple profiles.;
Lolu app;
The app is great but it's also fun*king annoying one minute I can follow someone the other minute I can't Sometime I can't even post really had a rough time with it but I love the app that's why I'm giving it 5 star please fix the issues And another thing it keeps blocking me out of the app some times saying we restrict so so nd so something like that pls fix the app;
Zucks sucks;
great app !;
Inútil;
Great;
Is my thinks;
Thanks For the New App Threads And Welcome For My World Art Modern Sarkis Matta ,Museum S.M Art Modern Internatilnal Thank You;
It's annoying that I can't delete threads without deleting my Instagram ca. You guys please fix this;
better than Twitter;
Worst experience and wrost app also;
كاكا نونو;
good;
ok;
When I try to write a thread it keeps crashing again and again;
Awesome and easy;
Just Bad;
Love it but I can't even reply or post atm pls fix the bugs so I can thread;
Good;
The idea of the app is fun. It feels like a safe space where people are sharing thoughts and ideas. There are a few bugs, sit crashes often and it has slowed down IG as well. But it's a new app. I'm not expecting perfection yet since it was only launched a week ago.;
twitter tryna be;
Nice one;
I use it in my sister phone cuz she have insta but the bad thing u neet to create an insta account and after u come to threads for that i think i not gonna use it and i think if u can create a new account in this app it will be good and it be better than Twitter btw i still using Twitter;
Can't search for users Have to scroll all the way up to refresh, no pull down to refresh. Have to click multiple times to see reply to a reply. Didn't get get any activity from followers on my post. Unclear if they are inactive or not seeing my posts.;
😴😴;
Worst app i recommend and request not to download it It is Matrix;
okay naman;
Ok;
Stupid app useless;
Good Application 😊;
Good;
Just a boring app, there's no discovery through topics, you just get posts from influencers meta wants you to follow, and not based on your interests.;
এই app a কোনো মেয়ে নাই। 🥺;
is better than Twitter i used to have Twitter but i can't use Twitter no more because someone blocked me;
Awesome;
I just don't like it sorry 😓;
Twitter is better;
😊😊😊👌👌🎉🎉🎉🤗;
garbage;
The app got many bugs Its crushing;
Unlike this app, Twitter is for the free: Free speech. No government censorship. Less data collected. Contribute your voice to humanity’s digital public square! The best way to fight misinformation is to respond with accurate information, not censorship.;
Its a great app;
I like the simplicity and the focus on conversation. Plus, no ads yet, which is why I gets 5 stars. There's no clear organization of threads. I like the panorama photo presentation, too, it's slick. Threads can't take credit for the quality of users, but I'm rather enjoying the pleasant and kind people I see on there.;
Steal all your personal data as usual from meta nothing new;
it was great! lovin' d app so far 💘 pero I hope it have like the thing to pin ur post;
Good 👍;
Pure copy cat with subtraction of (freedom of speech) remove sensorship then we can consider;
must be include dark mode;
Signed up, seeing nothing but utter rubbish, people who like the sound of their own voices.;
Downloaded on day one and have througoly enjoyed this app since. People actually interact with each other and far right trolls don't even last a day. Oh, and I haven't seen a single ad!;
New issue, people are replying to me but I haven't seen any of their reply notifications for NINE hours! I've cleared cache, logged out and back in, uninstalled and reinstalled, still not seeing notifications of replies.;
Nice app;
Couple of days after launching and nothing is working.;
nice and simple. although unlike twitter you can only see things posted by people you search for or follow;
Nothing special, just an imposter of Twitter;
Useless app;
Il stick to twitter. Too much.;
It combines the worst of Instagram and the worst of twitter;
Trash. Twitter is so much better;
Is the best;
Twitter from china 😭😂😂;
Twitter is best;
Excelente app, la desinstalé a los 3 días.;
عالی;
It's okeh but bruv, if u wanna compleat add story & ig music with reels too, Incld adding hash tags & music to photos, it would work so much better like fr, don't have any other problems tho, also messaging people too yk, Cos it's kinda hard to use ngl.;
Rubbish;
Please give some million followers;
So so boring;
Much comfortable to post and much simple and minimalist design, great app and i hope it updates more features;
Thanks again;
As boring as it could be;
Minimalist and clean UI Design;
The app is full of bugs;
Great app, however the translation feature is missing;
Its good;
It's a nice app and getting addicted to it day by day.. even it is more exciting and easy to use this app..;
SUPER DOPE.....! Kinda better thank Insta....(As per my Opinion heh);
Great I built it! 😁;
It has a lot of problem with persian (farsi) language but except that one thing , it's incredibly good;
Good;
So far so great! Just deleted the bird after 14 years.;
Very nice application;
It doesn show the replies in posts. It shows something went wrong. The only screen that works is the wall, for all the others it shows something went wrong. How possible a giant company makes such a trash application;
so nice app;
كي نمي;
Rey2Eer44Tttt;
Only log in thru Insta. Should have been other options too. Downloaded and then deleted as no other log in options available. What if people not having Insta, wanna onboard threads for a different experience;
You can't create a new account. You have to use an already existing instagram account. Also, there is no website on PC. Useless.;
"Kye ghatiya app hai 😡 Ek bhi ladki reply nahi karti "" DoN'T INSTALL THIS APP""";
Pretty much a copy of Twitter except you'll get censored if you speak out about certain topics so no free speech!;
Wow;
Twitter Ka Copy Paste 🤣;
Garbage app filled with bots and just an echo chamber for liberals who don't like their opinions questioned.;
Very nice! However definitely needs a media tab;
Great 👍;
Nice;
Amazing;
"Its just not working. It was fine for a while but something happened and now whenever I try to check my notifications or write something, it says ""sorry something went wrong"". Tried reinstalling, didn't help, it's simply just broken. I was already disappointed in this half-baked trash that lacks even the most basic functions like hashtags, but at my current state, I'm unable to do anything but refresh the timeline which is filled with unfunny meme accounts and verified scum. Unusable. Zuck lost.";
Good;
Copy paste;
Its good because it's more usful than Twitter. There is a insta from threads thanks for Alon musk to build thse app.😘😘🥳;
everytime i want to upload a photo, the app stopped working!;
This best app;
It's okay but no need to make it;
bad app;
This sooo perfect app....;
7u;
Publicity highly misleading. Should be a stand-alone app but instead it's only available tied to your Instagram account. If it WERE stand-alone, I would most probably use it - the world needs an alternative to Twitter... AND to Instagram (even though they're both Meta). Uninstalled.;
Yea toh khul hi nahi Raha;
Sure, I'd be happy to review Instagram Threads for you. Threads is a standalone app from Instagram that was designed to be a more personal and private way to connect with your close friends. It's a great way to share your day-to-day moments with the people who matter most to you, without having to worry about your posts being seen by a wider audience. Some of the things I like about Threads include: It's a more personal and private way to connect. Threads is only visible to your close friend;
This is garbage 🗑;
Useless;
Oo lovely app 😚;
Super app;
Not good, always glitch;
Better;
Nice;
Better then Twitter;
🙂👍;
Please add more login options, i.e with facebook ,mobile number and email I.D?;
Zucked twitter, for people on their 10th booster and said they were leaving twitter 100 timesBig ol L of an app!! Rated 1 star but truly deserves a 0, like marks game, we truly need Myspace Tom back...;
Good 🙏;
Total copy of Twitter;
It's not working. It's always give me error. It keeps on telling me sorry something went wrong. Try again;
Worst algorithm ever;
Good for now;
Stat is my threads an Instagram thanks for you insta tim;
Nice app;
It's pretty good but it is a lot for the first couple of days. Baby steps, but I prefer wasteof.money because it's smaller. Edit: this is pretty good +1 star. The problem is the community is really abnormally almost annoyingly large.;
Worst app please don't use;
Nice app untill elon musk victory/final move;
Best;
I am intagaram reel;
Nice;
Better than Twitter but it's bit less feature less ...;
It's copy of Twitter and it for those who are G.;
Wannabe Twitter.;
garbage echo chamber app;
Thanks Zuck,😘😘😘🌺🌼💐🌷🌸😊;
Nice;
My personal rating for many reasons.;
Instagram best;
Poor design. No use! Twitter is good and professional;
𝕾𝖔 𝖋𝖆𝖗 𝖘𝖔 𝖌𝖔𝖔𝖉....𝖏𝖚𝖘𝖙 𝖌𝖊𝖙𝖙𝖎𝖓𝖌𝖛𝖙𝖔 𝖐𝖓𝖔𝖜 𝖙𝖍𝖎𝖘 𝖓𝖊𝖜 𝖆𝖔𝖔😊;
This app is to copy of insta and twitter;
I haven't run into many issues, mostly because I'm not much of a poster so I'm not adding photos and everything else, BUT the past couple of days my feed is full of accounts I don't follow. Sometimes it's because someone I follow commented or rethreaded it, but that's not usually the case anymore. I use the app to keep up with and engage with the people I actually follow, not everyone else;
Eh, just installing because Elon is so annoying.;
Excellent 💗👌👌👌👌👌;
Doesn't work. Showing something went wrong in every screen, complete waste;
It's not good as Facebook;
Good;
There is unnecessary things on your feed and there is no option to view only following ones, everything becames about photos and photos, of this is another Instagram then why the f i use this over twitter, Twitter is still the best..;
I just installed it to give one star.;
Free lover comedy show 🥰 YouTube channel 🙏 please support me channel 🙏 comments follow;
Spy software that shizzts on your freedom of speech and rights;
🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬;
Bed service;
Very bad;
Worst;
Twitter is better;
Can't even got the code;
Copying an app is not a good thing.;
Twitter is better;
Mediocre at best. Disappointing launch.;
❤️;
Useless;
Worst app don't install it;
Nice app;
great;
I love how simplistic it is. I also really like that you can't DM, so I feel like I won't get harassed by bots. It's way more simplistic compared to Twitter, but I prefer it this way. - Update 7/15/2023 I lower my review to 3 starts because the app stopped working properly. It won't load posts on anyone's profile including mine anymore. My activity feed will not load. And I can't load replies on posts. It's really disappointing.;
Very nice app;
brilliant;
bad experience twitter is always best;
Good app;
Not a good one;
Nice;
Nic content;
Can't delete the account;
Not ok;
Bekar isne meri Facebook ki I'd delete krdi koi download mat Krna;
Fake app;
King of sensorship , u banned Andrew tate for free speech, piss off;
Helpful apps Please grow my account;
Horrible experience all around. Obviously too rushed with not much thought pit into it;
I hate this app not good i iavoit this app i give star 5/0 he worth it 5/0 but i give it 5/1 thanks to me 😂😂😂😂😂;
Worst 🤧😞;
👍👍👍;
Good;
Alpha version;
Can only use your Instagram info which includes your name and can only change anything through there. If I make one with a new email I probably have to make a new Instagram as well so nah I'm cool;
Boycott 👎;
Hahahaha, Elon musk better play than You;
The Scrolling is not smooth like other Meta Apps. I have to push the content up hard. Please fix this.;
Basically like Twitter bunded with your insta account and if you wanna logout on threads you basically have to logout from your insta Id;
It will be interesting if it is also compatible with Mastodon. Then it will really be better than Twitter.;
It's new but let see what is the Fucture of Threads;
I don't know what the problem is I can't log in. Please I need help.is popping up an error message 🙏;
Dawnload krne ki glti na kre kiyunki ye aap khud m hi ak glti h;
Right time Entry intersting app;
This apps is good but I need translate..please put a translation for me to understand the writing;
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻;
💖💖💖;
Not good experience 😕;
Too much censorship, Twitter is better.;
Spyware;
Bad experience at all;
So far it's good but I think it needs to personalize your feeds and also had a Direct Message option kos I can't be going to Instagram anytime time I want to a have a private conversation with my threads followers;
It's OK but it's crashes to much;
I like your new app;
Lacks features such as bookmarks, see thread likes, translation threads, and many more, please release these features soon so that this app can replace that blue bird app;
delete thread account and Instagram account is also deleted. Lol;
They loot your photos, videos, browser history, etc... Totally unsafe. Uninstaling threads app;
Hello, I need to complain about this, I haven't been able to use this application for 2 days because I'm having trouble. I can't reply to other people's posts in the reply column, I also can't post my own Threads status, please fix this glitch, thank you.;
بهترین ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐;
not interesting;
Don't use this app if you installed this app and log in with Instagram id your not delete threads account. If you delete your threads account than Instagram account also delete.;
More like Instagram than Twitter. Too much media. You can't even disable videos being played automatically! That's a big issue for me!;
Can't install app!;
Just great;
"""Your thread failed to upload."" Useless app, nothing works except the feed which can't be sorted and search is only for names but no matter, clearing cache, uninstalling etc. it is still impossible to post or see notifications.";
Good;
Wow 💯❣️;
Nice🥰;
No recommend;
❤️;
I like this app;
I'm unable to follow back. My followers are complaining of me not following back, please do something about it.;
It's a mimick of Twitter.;
It's realy cool;
NYC app but message option no;
There's a bug when using this app on Galaxy S23 Ultra. When i open the app, on home screen it's showing blank and only displays bottom icons . When i click on other icons they are responsive. I thought it was a slow network issue, tried to rest the phone but nothing. I hope this will be addressed via an update.;
Good;
All yltje best;
Very nice app, but can anyone tell me how 🤔 to unhide the ID in insta???????;
Perfect app 👍;
Its just a copy paste. That's not fair. Elon Musk is a nice guy, while lizard boy is a villain.;
Unable to use the app.;
Better than another one;
Nice;
CopyCat of Twitter. Sorry, Sorry CrossBreed of Instagram and Twitter = Threads;
Copied from Twitter;
Nothing new, same old boring;
Why it's making my insta experience very bad automatically making my account public and private like hackers do i think it got hacked;
Good;
Boring;
It's boring already Someone should tell mark Zuckerberg to please do something;
Poop. Very buggy and useless. Shut up meta. Twitter is just much better.;
Outstanding 😍;
Hi, threads team This app randomly crashes on this Android phone. Like, double triple screens , overlapping etc.. And if I can send u some of my screenshots that would be helpful for you;
Copy of twitter;
No draft icon, on the other hand the feeds refresh is slow. Moderately a good app tho;
Buggy;
This app is NOT good at all. Do not waste your time trying to make it work. The algorithm is the worst recommending stuffs that are completely different from your insta account. It seems like people are just tryif to use the app, but there is nothing really interesting A complete waste of time. I'll stay in Twitter btw;
Jha2 app;
It's not bad but it has some way to go before it can compete with Twitter. For me personally the app is just too basic and lacks features. Also, not a fan of not being able to register via email rather than through instagram. Obviously it's still early days but I'll be uninstalling for now.;
So good;
"There's a problem with ""notifications"". Bc it notify me not only their posts but also comments every single time! I wish I could add a screenshot. It has to be fixed.";
Need Improvement .... Mark Forget About Elon And Please Do Something About That Glitters...;
🙄;
Boring;
Nice;
Can't login because apparently i don't meet the requirements to do so, and when i can i can't even look at who followed or my own threads, really annoying;
Seema really biggy and broken right now. Will update if they fix it but right now, not really there .;
Waste app;
Twitter copy, the app isn't even good, no dms , no hashtags, no trending topics tab. It is made just to promote cancel culture.;
Good;
I love it but it's so lag and so many error. Pliss fixed it.;
Great App;
Gajjab;
Nice;
Very Bad app;
Nice;
Really glitchy at the moment. Can't reply to others'threads or replies in my threads. Eveytime I type replies the app closes completely. Can only write new threads so basically just talking to myseld with no way of interacting with anyone at the moment.;
It's a worst app and waste of time,net ,;
I have been face some problem. When I will be a post every times it's will be failed. So you should solve this problem as soon as possible.;
This is amazing apps;
not bad;
Majidul;
It crashes when I type more than 5 words.;
The apps is really great;
Best app 👌👌;
So much better than twitter;
عالی;
Aşırı b.oktan bir platforma dönüştü 1 haftada, ne kadar aptal fenomen ve içerik hırsızı kalitesiz davar varsa doluştular, işin kötüsü sadece takip ettiklerimizi görme diye bir seçenek bile yok, düzelirse ki çok zor belki tekrar yüklerim ama şuan twitter o kadar saçmalığa rağmen bundan kat kat iyidir.;
Good application Thanks Instagram team 🤝💯🥰;
I don't understand exactly why this app is used for;
Yaa. Use the people..... Better than twitter...;
First installed on my iPhone. Worked OK for a few days but then stopped showing notifications (just keeps saying try again). Refreshing doesn't help. Reinstalling doesn't help. Can't see comments on other posts. Tried the Android version and got exactly the same experience. Needs fixing;
स्लसबब्दंडकण्डवढे;
👁️👁️👁️;
Its eerr.. its an okay app.;
The content is compelling but Search, Activity & Posting stopped working for me a couple of days ago. I tried re-installing several times as well as clearing cache.;
Op;
Copy of Twitter, I Just Installed It To Follow The Great Leader Imran Khan.;
All I see is photos everywhere instead of text;
Only because I can't give ZERO.stars. Deleted.;
The fact that they locked us in without the option of deleting our account is a big NO for me.;
Just copy of twitter with more control of what you twit( thread);
Nice;
Gu kha 😐;
Hummmm;
Application are very useful for knowledge;
Унітаз цукера, так ще й не змили, придивіться в іконку детальніше;
10 k followers please 🥺;
Twitter 2007 is what you get with this app. I want to know how to completely delete my threads account without deleting my Instagram.;
Best;
تطبيق سئ;
The restriction messages are annoying and once they start you won't follow people successfully even when you are logged in. You follow on your endand the person is not followed on the other end;
No install account auto ban;
The app keeps jamming and thr texts on my screen are all jumbled up and i wanna swnd a screenshot of the issue too bad i cant😭;
💯💯💬;
Bad;
Was already not a big fan of Twitter and hence threads is no different;
Waste;
Very bad copy of twitter;
Copy of twitter;
❤️❤️;
Fraud people.....If you are deleting thread account your instagram too will get delete.... It's a scam.....;
It should be for non instagram users also.;
❤️;
Awesome;
Overall I love the app. However.... I have not been able to follow new people or follow back any of my new followers for over 3 days now and I can not get anyone to help with this issue. Ive even tried to become verified but guess what can't do that either. This is very very frustrating!!!!! 3 stars because of this issue could be 5 if someone from support could help me out.** 5 days now so I'm going to start dropping the stars.;
Since day one I am using this app ... I don't know what is the use of this app ...whatever I post no one even see my post..no like no comments .. and now there is bug in this app , a am not able to see anything which i uploaded . Its showing me error. . Something went wrong Try again.. what is this now????;
Copy of Twitter but grey;
Twitter is much better than this app;
From tiktok wannabe reels now Twitter wanna be thread. So un orisinal 😌;
Nice;
Chi;
I don't have any issues whatsoever with threads😍 this is even better than twitter;
Nice;
Good;
If you download and get an account and after you tired of this app then you wanna delete your account it may affect your Instagram account i mean if you delete your threads account you will also lose your instagram account too so if you don't want this happen uninstall your threads 😌;
Bruh there is nothing special it's just like twitter;
Nice;
Terrible app;
Nice;
This app is awsome they work with honesty❤️;
The app is not responding in my phone I'm using infinix s5;
Really one of the best app;
This is my favourite app 😘😘😘😘;
Varry nice app🥰🥰;
Weeks into that inaugural June training, one volunteer, a disabled retired Marine Corps captain, called the local sheriff’s office to report he was battered by Florida National Guard instructors when they forcibly shoved him into a van after he questioned the program and its leadership.;
Dear thread team i had an new updation idea for being better for you;
Good App. Good answer of Twitter.;
Highly appreciated app❤️❤️🙏;
Is very good app;
Wonderful app a better app than twitter;
Don't mystak;
"I can't see replays on any posts and activity tab is also unavailable. I just see the message ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again""";
Successful;
This app take too much time to upload post;
Doesn't work on newest version of Android, better to use twitter;
Love zuku bhai YouTube ki bhi copy bna do;
Follow up dai _nishal;
Good so far hope to see it grow with more options;
Disgusting;
Cheap shot!!! Don't install this & give you data to monopoly agenda;
I tried to download it but it couldn't because the size of the shop is 4GBs;
Nice;
Does this look bad Visually;
So much better than the bird app. They are adding new functionality every week, just give it time.;
Wow but reels option is not there so over all experience is 👍 good;
Mobile data lik....;
Nice;
Elon musk;
Fantastic app;
I will be happy to give Threads another star when you enable a translate function on individual posts.;
Good;
Osm 😀;
Zuckerberg is a cunning foxy devil;
No 😔 downloading 😕 why;
Nice app;
No safe;
Super 😊 nice 🌈❤️😲;

Twitter is the best;
❤️❤️❤️❤️;
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰;
Op;
Bad;
It was aight👍;
Good;
Twitter better ain't gonna lie;
It's just too random with no control over who's post pops up on feed, kills the purpose of following/unfollowing folks. In a way, it's worse than seeing ads. It'd be usable if we could limit main feed posts to only the ones who we follow and then a separate explore/Activity section.;
"Unable to login. ""Not permitted""";
Stupid App cheating 😒 Twitter not ethics follow 🙄 Mark Zuckerberg;
Wonderful... Just need some new features;

This is nice app;

Ok;
We don't need any new freaking app anymore. We need to stay by ourselves.;
Nice;
not good;
We need a chating area;
First two days it was Ok, the third day,Screen acted wierdly as I opened the app. I thought its my Phone's display fault at first. And Another problem is that I am unable to switch accounts instantly just like we do in Instagram.;
All is well;
Boringgg;
Useful pletform;
I love u mark Zuckerberg xD;
wala lng trip ko lng;
So many bugs, the feed will reload under you, you open it and you're back viewing an old thread like it just won't let go.;
This app is pretty calm and easy to use;
A very nice experience with the app, one week into the app and I'd say it's better off Twitter..... looking forward to the new update....;
The best no very very very best aap..;
बकवास!;
New Twitter;
Ugly bad app they want competition against twitter hey mark listen to me you can't control us only twitter Elon Musk live long...;
Good;
Péssimo aplicativo, não respeita a liberdade individual, algoritmos pra roubar dados e suasbconfidencias será vendidas para outras empresas assim como acontece na maioria das redes sociais, mas Threads se superou, instalei o app apenas para fazer a reclamação e já estou desinstalando, jamais irei logar minha conta aqui;
App đỉnh đáng dùng;

Nice App;
I'd give it 5★ but you must let us edit photos before posting lmao;
Very nice app 🖤🖤👍👍👍;
Worst app to use... It is not highlighting trending stories;
Threads is good but this app copy of Twitter;
🙂🙂;
Twitter is Best Bruh! This is too much booring.;
Ui is worst;
It's a great step, but I wish it was more convenient. Placing the comment and like button in accordance to your hand as I am a right handed I would like them on the right side. Double tap on like also needed.;
I like this app ❤;
Why we need a copycat app?;
copy paste from twitter;
This will be a good competition for twitter Cause twitter now suuuuucks;
Useless Application;
i like you very much I spend most of my time on the app I love you simple and it has a very simple home interface that's why i like you so much। 🙂👍🏻🥰;
excellent experience 😉;
Gandi bari deba install mat karo 🤬;
Copycat;
Such a boring app;
King elon !!!;
This is most virul app;
It's good to use;
An ugly copy of twitter.;
Stupid app. Just keeps buffering.;
"It is actually a good app... I love the app but I am having post issues... Mark did a great job but he can do better.... I can't enjoy threads while it keeps showing ""post failed to upload""";
i love you;
Worst app;
"Doesn't work at all. I'm unable to check notifications nor my profile (""Sorry, something went wrong."" error). I also can't post anything (""Your thread failed to upload."" error). Additionally threads in feed are displayed randomly, threads from people i follow are almost impossible to spot in between so spammy, unrelated content.";

Nothing new.i didn't like it;
It suddenly closes. I thought I just accidentally hit my home button but no. I was typing but overtime, it suddenly closes. There was even no draft of the text I was composing. Happened multiple times. I just updated this app and thought that it would fix the issue, but no. This is also the reason why I stopped using this the last time, I got frustrated because it kept refreshing(?) or closing and the thread I was composing is not even saved.;
The app doesn't have a dark mode;
Content overlapping;

This aap is launched new. But this aap is so good I like this aap;
Awesome;
The copying is not good;
Its woke;
It's app not best not entetentme this app very bad 😞 app;
So far it's nothing new nor innovative, nor is it anything near Twitter - which is more smooth and users have more control over what is actually on their feed. That sluggish scroll this App has is very annoying and honestly quite irritating.;
Nice apps dear;

It's boring but cause everyone is on it I am on it.;
So cool man I like it 🌡️;

This app is super sus...couldn't control my phone Couldn't exit app Auto downloading random stuff from YouTube All happened after using this app for a few sec;
No privacy 👎.;
I keep getting thread unable to load notifications today and banned from following people a lot. Not all of us had an instagram instafollowing. Many of us from twitter had large accounts and have come to this basic, phone only site, and are liking the atmosphere and baring with the lack of functionality we are used, such as, hashtags and content search engines. We mostly wish they would at least lift what is causing these following bans so we could all get reconnected here on Threads. 💙;
Better than Twitter but still run by another fool.;
no privacy. meta want to know about you everything. be careful;
Stiff 1:1 scrolling makes this essentially unusable as a modern social media app. Just use regular Android scrolling.;
Cheap Copy of Twitter;
Seems like a Twitter wannabe.;

I know it can't be exactly like T!, but it just doesn't function properly. It's going to need some improvements. Until then I'm on that other app.;
Give us dark mode 💀💀💀;
There's no option to delete my account why ?;
What is this. A official copy of Twitter?;
I've tried multiple times to log in by using my Instagram info, and it keeps stating that he info is incorrect. It isnt worth any more of my time. ,🤷;
Wow;
I can't delete without deleting Instagram, this is a tie-in;
Fake;
Would prefer a hashtag and trending section but so far the experience has been positive.;
Twottwer, see you in cage zurk.;
When i start to post in threads everytime crash I hate this;
Kuchh samajh nahi aa raha;
Twitter copy lol;

WHY I CAN'T DELETE MY ACCOUNT WITHOUT DELETING INSTAGRAM.;
Good experience threads app Good morning;
Twitter is better.;
Copy krna ho toh Instagram se sikho . .. ...;
If you will login once in threads, you can't delete your threads profile ever. If you want to delete your threads profile, your Instagram profile will also delete. You can only deactivate the threads account. So think before download.;
👍;

Frequent to crash everytime. Fix it!;
is there any way to get my badge back?;
Lol, these children rating it a 1. Great app.;
Threads is trying so hard to be like twitter and insta but proves to be worse than both.;
Thread is my favorite 👌;
Bugs bugs bugs everywhere there's bugs;
Great app you ca use it;
This app is best or not please say;
👍;
It's a far worse version of Twitter. Only one feed filled with random accounts I have 0 interest in following. There's no hashtags, no related accounts pop up when you follow someone. Account is attached to Instagram, so you'd have to delete your insta account to delete your threads one and there's trending tab of course. It's not horrible but feels very rushed, random and insular.;
Nice App;
Yes they copied twitter but i feel I'm being monitored closely. Reading their privacy policy after i opened an account, i found out all my data is being used and sold. Also i can't delete my account without it affecting my Instagram.(An account deleted on Thread also delete their Instagram account). I would advice you don't download this app because you need an instagram profile to do so. Soo sad.;
The app keeps removing and crashing in android 😠;
At least no issues for now;
Best;
Mast;
নতুন কিছুই পেলাম না;
This is clearly a very early and poorly tested version of the app that was pushed out to cash in at the right time. First, the app crashes a LOT. Simply opening certain people's threads closes the app every time, but works perfectly on other threads. This is pretty much a deal breaker. Second, I think it's fair to say a web version or desktop app should have been available from the beginning. The fact that it's missing just means it's all a side effect of rushing out this new platform. AJ 505;
Good application but sound will off in video don't an auto sound play option;

No better;
Just go to Twitter.;

The fact that one cannot delete himself from it seperatley from Instagram is alarming. It's kind of useless, no point. Boring.... No hastags... Just for corporate to advertise their own means.;
that's pretty good, but you forgot the dark mode in the app please, when you'll update the dark mode I'll come back to fill the last two star🌟;

Twitter sucks, but this is somehow even more of a tasteless hellscape.;

Amazing 👏;
Wow nice app;
Try it more using;
Good aap;
Nice app;
The app is going well and nice, easy to use, and friendly. But I recommend a delete, edit,and save option. A Delete option to be able to clean the activity or notification. To be able to edit a message or picture to add a caption when it's already posted, and a save and bookmark option. I personally need the delete option, I can't help but get anxiety when my activity is messy. I tried checking a post notification of an activist, but it swarmed up my activity history. Please add options.;

"I got regretted when I created an account at this trash app. Also it stopped working just because I'm in the country that the app is not available. I used VPN to access and after 2-3 days, the posts stopped showing and says ""something went wrong, try again"" and I can't post as well, and even If I want to deactivate my account it says ""failed to deactivate"". What's wrong with this trashy app. There is Twitter and is enough, there is no need for creating a clone trash with same idea as Twitter.";
Its IS very beoutifall;
SALAMAT ito na Yung bagong Instagram 😲😘 nakakaiyak.;
Threads, an Instagram app is a big no-no for me. The app is glitchy, slow, and boring. It's like a bad version of Twitter that nobody asked for. Why would I want to use another app to share text updates and join public conversations when I can already do that on Instagram or Twitter? The app also makes me nervous about my privacy and security, as it may share my data with third parties without telling me. Threads, an Instagram app is not worth my time or my phone's memory.;
Not interesting like Facebook or Instagram;
This is very vender full application;
The App keeps closing when I tried write more than one sentence and tag my friends.;
Excellent;
This app is boring, what's the point of having this? You have 1000s of followers and get 5 likes. What a waste of time this app is. Worst part is all you see are verified people complaining about irrelevant things in their perfect lives.;
Too much errors;
This app very expanceve✅✅;

Definately a better option than Twitter some might say it a straight copy I agree but its way more better in experience, decluttered, more transparent, one thing I feel that should improve on is to make the so app or account a seperate entity.;
Why doesn't it have a dark mode??? Needs a dark mode.;
very poor app and can't access it. They asked to access via Instagram and can't work. Not convenient app and wasted of time to deal with.;
Best then twi;
Screw twitter;
Hype created agnest Twitter. Unfortunately it is not compatible with Twitter. If Twitter is 100% then Threads is 50%.;

Twitter Alternatives;
Totally insane this instagram/threads. NEVER had instagram acct. Downloaded threads app, need instagram acct to log in. Set up new acct w instagram Says I have an acct. Reset pwd Now cant log in bcuz of suspicious activity AND all of Instagram emails are in GERMAN ???;
Was rushed out the door, lack of features, and lack of pages/people to follow. Also the app uses a lot of personal data, so be wary of that.;

It's a cheap copy of TWITTER. Most of the content here is of Instagram only.;
Rubbish application, this application is not properly optimized.;
زباله;
Meta is censuring and stealing our data. I prefer the twitter.;
That's a pice of sh.. copy;
🗑️;
The feed is completely useless. As for content the non humourous meme pages are all over. If they are not then some random person posting her pic making it Instagram 2.0.;
Very nice;
I don't like the strategy which used that we need to delete the Instagram also of we don't want threads.;
Nothing new.;
It's a good app, Still in the early stages but I would much rather use this than that other app;
Useless;
Bahut wahiyat chiz hai Bhai 🙄😵;
Let seperate the app with Instagram;
I mean why.....;
"Better than Twitter. Less dictatorship from the CEO. Less drama. Less advertisements. For now. Missing ""spaces"" like conversations.";

Guuuuuuu;
Poor app it's not for Geopolitical movements so bad as Instagram;

Dire. Installed and uninstalled because the flow of it isn't upto scratch. You get random posts in your feed. The data collection is very bad and intrusive;
Coz !! Our official account can be deleted if we delete threads !! So badd;
Feature to download photos would be nice.;
Great experience so far;
It was working perfectly until a few days ago and now I can't see anything in my activity tab, I can't post any new threads, I can't reply to any threads, I can only see the first post in a thread but none of the replies. I can still like threads and follow people and that's it. It's pretty much useless to have a social media app if I can't interact with any of my friends and followers. So disappointed. I really thought I had found a viable replacement for that trainwreck of a blue bird app.;
Bad and copy paste app from twitter app.Mark Zuck is cuck. Elon is king 👑;
I Don't using is apps;
"There's no way to see only posts from people you follow in chronological order, so you're never ""caught up."" Happy to try it again if they change that, but until then it's trying to be an infinite timesink and I'm not into that.";
You have to delete all apps to delete it 🤢💩;
Mark Zuckerberg please try and add where by we can dm our love ones there like IG;
Fast user;
keren;
👍🏻;
This good application for international environment;
Why am i not seeing my comments until I'm done typing;
Horrible;
Is very bed;
What is this app even for?;
"It has been a great app since my day 1 of use, but it's been 2 days now that I can't post a new thread It keeps showing ""your thread failed to upload"" Why?";
I don't know how to explain it but i like it more than twitter😂;
"The start is much better. Keep up the good work. I do understand that the app it's still new so I'm hoping you will make it even much better than what you have done. What I can say is ""Keep up the good work "" but don't be like other platforms that blocks people's accounts permanently for no reason.";
Good;
Perfect😍;
Don't install. Protect your data.;
Boring;
بدک نیست.;
Not worth switching from other social media. File upload is a fail and the setup is a disaster. I will change my review if you make this app usable.;
it's ugly if we see about home page , it's simillar of twitter and it's like just new virsion of it . Try to change the way to use it , it's gonna be more better and it cames with people when you do .;
Full of bots or people who apparently don't know how to say more than 1-2 words. There is absolutely 0 conversation happening and there is no way to see who I'm following. This was a completely half baked app that I'm almost sure it was forcefully published in the midst of Twitter having a crisis so they could try and gain some ground on Twitter. At the end of the day, both apps are terrible.;
😥;
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣;
Code has be copied from Twitter;
The app is broken for me and it doesn't work anymore. Plus the app optimization is just poor and it crashes more than often.;
cannot download images;
Iigg;
I can't download the app;
Updates and upgrades are needed but so far it works well.;
Great app and I know Mosseri admits that some functionality is missing but I'd really like to bookmark or save threads that are really interesting just like you can on Twitter.;
Just a china copy of twitter. Mark should create something of his own rather than copying stuff from others. Example, reels from tiktok, concept of stories on all his platforms which was copied from snapchat and now he copied whole application of twitter and gave it his own preferred logo and name. Btw the name Thread is only used in twitter lol.;
Meh.... it's ok for now. It's still new anyway. Looking forward to see it be improved;
Nice;
This app went from 4.9 stars to 3.2 stars. Crazy;
Bad;
nice app;
غير مفيد;
I cannot download it to my laptop. Apparently I can only log into it on my phone with Instagram? Big fat fail for me. I'm already over it.;
1 star for ripping off Twitter just to censor people again.;
Nice app but hope please add a dark mode feature specially those person who has sensitive eyes to gadget. I will rate 5 star if you complete all your features in threads.;
wanna try this out but i dont want to create instagram account, turned out i cant. uninstalled;
This soo good;
It good;
Bakwass people ne ishko bhi Instagram bana diya🤣🤣;
Woke garbage;
I can't log in with my Instagram. Keep telling me something went wrong, app not independent. Sad;
I don't like it;
Basically an Instagram remake with Metas same lame rules that until they disappear will not be able to take on Twitter which is a much better app. Lol this app is lame posts the exact same content as on Instagram what is the point;
App crashes if you attempt to @ someone & you start typing before the suggested accounts finish loading Huawei p30 pro, Android V10;
This app is actually really good;
Pointless app why let me follow people and then just show me posts from anybody but the people I follow;
Excellent;
*** DO NOT INSTALL *** The amount of personal information that it collect is beyond words. You'll be tracked in more ways that you can possibly imagine. Go to a mastodon server you tust. Go see your family and friends in person but please don't became a victim of yet another Meta/Facebook tracker.;
Unbelievable this app, even after 2 years of development, decided to launch w/o hashtags, a following-only feed, translation for posts and other basic features that are standard with social apps. If you want a Twitter alternative that serves you better, Mastodon is by far the only one.;
This apps is very nice;
I cant even log in;
Worthless Application in every aspect;
🤞📸;
Bro I couldn't find ma boi Elon or tate brothers;
This app is really awesome i think its better than twitter🥰;
Copy paste product;
Awesome. It's is a nice alternative to the bird app. I think it is safe for teenagers and and very nice and warm user base.;
Fuc_ king copy of Twitter zuck is th copy master;
I love it;
I HAVE NOT ISED YET, BUT TAE TOO MUCH SPACE ON YOUR PHONE, IT NEEDS REDUCE THE SIZES, TO MUCH MB FOR FEW ACTIONS, WHY?;
Good;
This is app for free and download the day I will be able to swipe reply using hai kya hai ye to Jaipur Rajasthan me hi nhi hai na ki nahi hai kya tu to kya hua hai kya tu to kya hua hai kya tu to kya hua hai kya tu to kya hua;
It's working very slowly;
I can't log in;
Buggy when i try to follow people, but otherwise wonderful.;
Nice;
Post notifications are delayed af, some posts get visualised as repries in the feed with that donut string, the ig symbol vanishes from all profiles, the sound symbol on videos just vanished! Why even release such an incomplete product?;
I love you THREAD INSTAGRAM 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖;
Not agre like this follow no;
Very good;
Twitter is the best;
So-so. Uninstalled for now. Maybe come back after better features added. ♥️;
এখানে একটাই সমস্যা বিডিওতে সাউন্ড বারে ওন করতে হয়৷ তা ছাডা সব পারফরম্যান্স ভালো;
Missing features like trending topics, search by keyword, filtering results by location, etc.;
Good;
please add massage;
Bekar;
Needs a following tab, the feed algorithm is hot garbage. Every time I open the app I'm assaulted by 20-30 posts of pure cringe before I see a single thread from someone I actually follow.;
"It started out promising but all I get now other than the main feed is ""Something went wrong, Try again later"" Definitely a thing on there end. Same on multiple devices and after uninstall and reinstall.";
Here we go!;
Falut app !!;
It's the copy of Twitter Worst app;
All of the best app;
Threads is really a great app but it'd been better if there's a DM;
Bad;
Supper;
Ok;
Copyright claimed;
I hope they add stories and messages to it, honestly make threads its own app.;
On f the best app;
It has been weeks and the app still glitches upon opening till the point that nothing is readable.;
Lizard guy stealing other people's plans;

Nice Application;
Super;
Elon bhaiya ki jai 😂👍;
Needs words, not a real twitter competitor just yet;
Good 👍👍👍👍👍 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳;
Needs a lot of work. Most of the time I can't see threads nor notifications, I always get a something went wrong message. The scroll is too slow. No indication if someone is following you or not.;
kinda boring like twitter better;
Please, make it easier to upload pics from gallery;
Fantastic;
This app is garbage doesn't even open most of the time;
Ball;
Very good app to connecting people;
Why not in urdu;
I am unable to post my comment on any thread. I am getting post failed to upload error .what is the reason behind it;
Good app. Slow and registration is cumbersome.;
👍👍👍;
So very nice app🥰💯❤️;
Trending topics and Hashtag not available?;
Ith kollaaaam;
Nice;
Twitter is best!!!!!;
Its ok;
working fine now. No lagging.;
Nice app hai;
It's a good start. But it needs a lot of new features. Especially a timeline for posts only from accounts you follow.;
great app and i really like it but i want to report a bug when you click on an image and you want to get out of it it shows a white screen and you need to get out and come back again to the app i hope you guys fix this bug;
I opened an account on the second day of the thread platform release. It's been eleven days since I've been using the Thread app. All very nice and interesting futures. Photo quality and video quality are very high, and very fast to use. Followers grow very fast, I like it very much. However, meta company should introduce chatting option in thread app and add some more futures.;
pointless;
It is the panic app;
Trash, Twitter on Top;
I don't want to see unknown accounts in my timeline. I want to live inside my own bubbles. Please make this option available.;
Clean functional and minimalist social town hall, keep the simplicity going!;
I'm really loving threads so far. My only suggestions would be to provide having multiple accounts logged in like Instagram does, and some UI customization like themes and colors, maybe headers for our accounts.;
"I can't read my profile and can't write anything as a message "" something went wrong"" keeps appearing. Already tried to delete cache but it does not solve anything";
Not bad...but not GOOD..;
King<3;
"""Something went wrong please try again"". Get this message all the time. Can't see replies, my profile and many other features. This message just pops up all the time. Also people I follow don't show up at the top of my feed. I get random recommendations at top. Back to Twitter until sorted.";
సుమిత్;
Good 👍;
Good;
Wow;
I make a better app name of this : E passport Online. This app w Help you to make or create passport. Also you wll get passport so fast. Thank you.;
Best;
Bakwas;
Installed Because I Like TopG Tate❣️;
'Every expensive thing has its cheap copy';
Need to improvement like # tag etc..;
It makes you deleted your Instagram account if you want to delete your threads account;
Pathetic not enjoyable;
Downloaded it, fight open it or anything. My phone beeped and warned of dados take down = {};
🥰🥀;
Most beautiful 🤩;
Evidently a rushed app to fill the gap left by twitter but it honestly does provide a better experience, if somewhat barenones. All it needs is a few feed options and that's kinda it. It shouldn't strive to do everything but instead focus in on text based content;
Supar;
Twitters still a bit better;
Nice app;
Trash liberal app don't install;
🖤💜💙💚💛🧡❤🤍🤎💔❤‍🔥❤‍🩹❣️💕💖💘💝💟;
It's a really great app. But there has been a problem,sometimes when i follow people it automatically unfollows them. 😥😥;
Avarage;
Twitter is way better!!;
No windows options. Bizarre, for a text based app... typing on a keyboard is still the fastest no matter the speed of your thumbs! Also the searching... trending... aspects as documented eleswhere.;
It started out great, but now I cannot even post my threads anymore, the app refuses to upload my threads🥺 I'm going back to twitter now😪;
A decent enough Twitter clone but cycling through irrelevant content just makes it feels exhausting. App needs a Followers tab or a better algorithm soon, or we're going to bail.;
Boring app and no effective allgorithm so post of user can go to other persons feed.;
Not good as Twitter it is like copy of that! 🤙🏻;
I can't comment on my moot posts, but I can post and follow the others. Can you fix it?;
I don't know what happened with my posting I can't post again;
This app r@pes the privacy of the users;
Rwsy,you ezn.;
Very nice aaps;
Sorry but this is bad app 😣😖😕😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨;
as boring as twitter, if you create a new social media app, make your algorithm fix first and make all your user have a better number of views and likes;
"we need ""following only"" feed";
I love this app very best quality..;
Average but not equal to Twitter;
Elon is supreme;
The news feed needs filters and this app is the EXACT copy of Twitter. This app Sucks;
Very bad;
Get log out and app crash when trying to post something, on mobile device;
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢;
Offlcial_sanu_1;
Have fun seeing what the people who made the app want you to see rather than what you want to see while your data is being sold to the gov;
ভবিষ্যৎ অন্ধকার 🙂💔;
Big app for people to share their feelings and thoughts to others easily;
Goood;
Going on two weeks since public launch now and this app is starting to suffer from lack of very common features (which honestly should have been standard at launch). No ability to filter your feed or search posts/tags. Account follower import seems to be messy for those with a larger following. It has some good things like in line thread adding good media display. But, these are not enough to keep the app afloat on their own.;
Not Bad;
It is worst;
This app a lot of work to be done on it so it will be better has Twitter e.t.c pls work on the message box;
Good;
this is just twitter LMAOOO;
Cant even uninstall 💀;
Crashes every time I select texts;
Nah cuz this app is trash ong Even as a Twitter copy it's bad asf;
Majaa nahi aaya;
No problem 👍;
Ok seriously, I can't post on anything on this app since the past two days and there's no update to rectify the issue;
Message option kidhar hai;
Twitter is better thanks to Elon. Threads is run with bots infected with the woke mind virus.;
Copy paste of Twitter copy cat threads;
Boring;
Why you connect threads with Instagram;
This app is good and better than twittar;
Stop copying twitter We talk in twitter freely so we stay on twitter;

No thank you. Too much privacy requirements are taken;

So cool app,and more better then twitter.;
Raj kumar Singh999;
annoying glitch every time I am typing something, the app would suddenly closed and everything I just typed would be gone.;
"There's a bug where even with fast connection it'll say ""post failed to upload"" or when i post something it'll automatically save in my phone ""which doubles it"" those bugs is soo tiring, as of the moment ngl twitter is better.";
Keeps crashing;
It's new app so good;
sahajdeep singh 💔💓;
Copy of Twitter 😆😆😆;
"Bugged and very basic ""Twitter"" clone.";

It worked well for a day or two, but now getting the Sorry Something Went Wrong error, which seems to effect the feed and notifications.;

Threads need to improve a lot. A lot.;
Very interesting app looks promising, but you hardly get engagement when you post! Why is that?;
Twitter forever;
Keep crashing while im still writing a content. Fix it with haste, or ill give a permanent 1 start;
I'm interested but keeps showing the same stuff, which makes me leave the app after about a minute and it's very annoying 🤷🏻;
Very good 👍;
I am very sad . Chatting features is not available 😭. How can talk to friends 😔. And Now am very upset 😤;
I want to delete threads account;
Sucks;

Perfect;
Threading all the applications.....;
It's a great experience but the app keep crashing, more that 10times today. Not sure if am the only one experiencing this.. fix it;
❤️❤️;
Good Very good;
Scam;
The app is not too stable,please fix META. Its Scattering text and pictures on my Andriod Device. Updated today 17th July 23. The problem is fixed. Thanks META. Please spice the app up lets beat twit.;
Cool 😎 to use thrrads. A good app. But in my point of view it should have to be updated like: Bring the post button at the top. Bring dark theme. Likes inactivity is good but bad than Twitter. Option of using hashtags and at last plz bring direct message.;
Good App Hello friend Download;
"For giving support to someone I know I installed this app ""Threads "" but when I come to know that If we delet this account same way my Instagram account which i have will also get deleted it's just against our freedom to use the app and the control was commanded by META.. not just me but many like me was wishing to delet this app without loosing data form Instagram...";
NICE;
Good App;

Unwanted App;
Isme to ladkiya reply degi naa ?;
Recently joined this app. App is still in the development stages and many things are missing. However. I absolutely loved the competing app before new owner tore it apart. I think Meta owner and his Executive have potential to tear ceiling off that and may have learned something from competing owner's recent failed experiences. I have much hope for Threads!;
Cannot post & view the stuff that I have already posted;
Stupid idea;
Ok;
The app doesn't work properly, it's full of bugs and errors, Even after deleting and reinstalling for a few times, it didn't get fixed.;
Cheap copy of twitter.;
Nice instagram 🍺🥰🍻🍻🥵;
👎👎👎;
National Post article says. Threads collects so much sensitive information it’s a 'hacker’s dream,' experts say Meta captures everything from the information you give it when you sign up for accounts, to what you click on or like, who you befriend online and what kind of phone, computer or tablet you use to access its products;
Didn't take long for all the comments to become spam. It's as bad as Facebook;
Booring;
Incredible;
please add a following-only timeline!!!! I don't want suggested posts or comments by the people I follow flooding my feed :(;
Dont waste ur Time Using It;
No option to recover password? Can't get in):;
Some videos don't have sound despite the mute button being available.;
Striking;
Great app but needs more features;
Frequent mistakes exit suddenly;
It came to surpass Twitter;
5 star;
Threads fell off 🧵;
Not interested;
Thank you so much sir;
Great app way... better than Twitter you have to give this app a change💙;
"I hope this doesn't fail to keep their word of ""non-toxic""";
Needs improvement but still a better alternative than Twitter for me.;
Can't save a photo;
No inbuilt dark mode :(;
Скачал эту полную копию Twitter, посидел минут 5 и забыл. Потом поменял пароль от Instagram и больше не могу зайти: говорит, пароль другой, а перелогиниться не даёт.;
🤫;
Wrost platform i ever seen;
Just waste;
Good 😊;
Threads 👌👍 Uninstall Twitter🙂🤸;
Waste app;
This is the best app created by humans without a doubt. I can give you my personal guarantee that this is absolutely the best app. Even if you're a hater you can't deny facts. It there was god he'd use this app as an example of perfection.;
I want to delete my account!!;
I am not interested to use this on Android, get it out for the web please, I want an alternative to twitter.;
Uploads are failing, automatic 1:1 cropping of photos, cannot choose other folders than the camera's default folder;
Awesome app;
not safe;
I think it'll be better if another update for threadsapp would enable you share a video posted on threads to Instagram story while it's playing and not a static pic of the video as it is now;
This is great app;
Incredible application just it needs some features;
This app died after one week of it's launch lol poor mans twitter that's what this app is.;
I love elon musk;
Hoping this would be easier to use than Twitter. But it's more difficult;
my threads always error until now.;
Bad! The app isn't tested enough! There has been an error in loading my threads account from 3 weeks and it's not fixed as of date! Cashing in at the right time without a full proof app is just pathetic;
Cringe app;
Terrible. All it does is promove unwanted christian posts and fake positivity posts everywhere.;
Zuccky is the most criminal man i saw ever;
Ok;
Please add (Stories & a messaging feature) overall app is great!;
Way too good!;
I can't review comments under my posts;
Love it. But still waiting for more improvements;
Yay;
Copied from Twitter;
Worst app like Instagram meta they are always against freedom of speech and expression. 👎;
Good;
Good 👌🏽;
Nice;
Good 😊 app;
Fam 🤣;
Good;
Useless App;
Useless;
I am giving this app 1 star coz i ain't Gay (Elon Musk Is King);
Missing a lot of features at the moment DMs, Gifs, following feed, save images and videos, bookmarks, a desktop site but that probably won't be for a while;
Bruh. No use;
We need the translation feature that exists on ig. Also, it'd be cool to get the trending now feature or something similar;
Heavily lacking features;
A good app so far. The people are nice and caring unlike that bird app. It needs some things yet, but I'm sure they will get there. I'm happy with it so far. ☮️🖖;
It's amazing ❤️;
Good 👍;
I really love to this app;
Very very good 👌;
Not so good;
I don't still understand the application Can't I send messages on the application;
theres a bugssss;
Dms should be introduced.and picture should be allowed to be adjusted;
Ruined Instagram in 2012, now managed to screw up a stillborn Twitter knock-off. Where is the chronological feed that only has what I follow? I got enough ad and algo filled feeds on other social media. Where are the photomaps and my old chronological feed on Instagram zucc??? I still remember what you guys did. Keep up the metaverse 😏🤡;
❤️;
App closes whenever I try to post anything. I resort to typing what I want to say externally then pasting it after.;
Crashes often;
Can't even search for things I like;
Bad app;
Hello can you add download the content, picture like twitter do please...;
Wrost than twiiter;
Not sure what was the need of this app if we already have Instagram and LinkedIn 😬😬;
This app has i have lots off bags;
add hashtags already;
It's pretty bare as an app, but that also means you can only add-on features at this point, which is exciting. There's needs to be an easier way to go from Instagram to Threads. Having two apps is a bit much. It would be cool if they could both live in the same space;
Best threads app;
It's an exceptional application;
Bahut bekar hai ye app Instagram ke sath kiyu joda Instagram is best.;
Why do you have to have Instagram?;
This app is very bad 🥺;
This low key not it if we're going to be honest. Twitter is still better.;
Need update 🙂;
Boring;
When are you adding the search feature for things that aren't accounts?;

Always crashes;
Always have something wrong and can not see posts and post anything;
Right now it's just a copy of everything that's happening on the internet. It does looks clean in comparison to the all ads populated social medias, that's something I like.;
Could not understand why I follow people. I was able to see many other peoples mesaages in my timeline as well;
I don't know what to say but I need to say something THIS APP IS AWESOME it have insta ui and twitter mixed I like this app;
Well, I'd love to use it but it won't let me post, I keep getting the 'Your thread failed to upload' message for days now. I tried clearing cache, force stopping, uninstall/reinstall...doesn't work. I'm giving it 2 stars because Instagram import seems to work and I could see other people's threads.;
Need to add some more features;
Very nice and nice and good;
Trash;
I gave 5 star to threads because of Alon musk.even I don't know the spell of his name.😜;
😡😡😡😡😡😡;
It's a copy of twitter , the app is launched to compete twitter,as mark Zuckerberg is a part of matrix ,decides to cancel the people who open minds ,so there is no freedom of speech , Zuckerberg doesn't know about privacy and decides who to ban and who to not ,can't ban woke but bans who are against it with the point of you ,;
Fail to upload any thread;
Like it;
Didn't work few days;
I don't like mark Zuckerberg, he is an lizard man.. And musk mama is the best mama..;
Twitter is the best.. This is copy app.;
Copy of twitter;
It's too good;
If I follow certain accounts there's a reason for that - I want to see what they post. I don't want to see other random accounts in my feed. I don't want your 'recommendations'. Not very usable; just like Instagram which is meh.
Error en el inicio de sesión;
Coolll app;
Waste application in world;
Whenever you want to post a new thread with a picture it crashes. Unsatisfactory.;
Can't use without IG account;
Forced close on launch. Had been great.. added 200 of the 300 twitter people I follow (mostly just EU accounts missing now). But desperately needs a keyword search to find anything other than what the people I follow said.;
I am not impressed. The app should have been separated from IG. Any restriction on one should never have to affect the other. Again, the whole idea of not having access to one's followers list at some point is annoying. Can we have a tab to mass-unfollow everyone who isn't following back. I need my time line to be filled with contents I choose to see from followers. It crashes a lot too.;
Unable to create an account as I do not have an Instagram account.;
Bajrang Hiii;

Very boring app;
Its a very good app;
It's just not very polished 😔;
Nice app;
Very vest of time application, worst experience, copy of Twitter, threads is a Twitter little brother, I deleted threads and all so Instagram, and Instagram like a tik tok 2.0 version, and really rate of both app 100/-1 they are deserving this rate.;
Just doesn't work.. I see posts but no replies instead it only says something went wrong.. And can't post anything only said post failed to upload. As it is now it's useless and I would hate going back to twitter.. I tried every suggested fix that can be found on the Web.. Nothing works..;

All problem fixed kro na please;

Excellent app but there is a problem app UI isn't good ui need to be more clean.;

"It was great until for some reason I get ""something went wrong"" message. I CAN'T post, comment, or even look at my own profile. Reached out and no help.";
Super;
Good app;
Ok;
It's not owned by a wannabe politician, but it's embarrassingly basic for a Facebook product. Needs hashtags or just a search feature, and a Trending list.;
Very limited features not comparable to Twitter;
Nice app;
Havent been able to use it since i dl it, just keeps saying sorry, something went wrong 🤷;

Why after posting a video on this app does the sound disappear? Don't have this issue on TWITTER......;

it was fun until it doesn't, there is no point in seen strangers I don't care publishing text;
Don't install this. It is worth app only 😂👎;
It just wow;
Systummm;
NEW UPDATE ITS BORING AGAIN WASTE TIME;
I literally can't look at my account and the stuff I've posted or the notifications. Keeps saying 'something went wrong';
Right now. This app sucks. No hashtags, no way of searching keywords. The only thing you can search is usernames. Your feed is loaded with a bunch of stuff you don't want to see. The app has potential but they rushed the launch. I'll give them a couple weeks to add some more features but right now there is no benefit for general users.;
Post failed, when ever I tried to comment under people's post it we throw error (post failed) that's the only reason am not okay with the app;
Gakjjjb;

You'd think Meta could create a better app.;
Super app;
Love you;

I wanted to try the app out but I don't have an Instagram account so it cannot sign up or try out the app. Don't need an Instagram account.;
Sir or medam of threads I don't no who changed my password plss give back my account as well possible plss sir;
The thread app should have the feature of downloading pictures and videos so that people don't use any other fake thread app....;
Nice.....!;
Not good;
It's tough to switch the multiple accounts;

Nice for now. I hope it will not become twitter. LE: now I have 'something went wrong try again' and I can't see comments, page and profiles..;
After using my account for a few days my account was blocked. I haven't even made a post, they just decided I wasn't me. I'm signed in through my Facebook account, which isn't locked.;
bad app yrr😡;
Love it;
Great app and Design is so cool.;
Way to many bugs and lagging slow speed and feel like total ripoff.;
Nikhil;
mark wasn't able to buy twitter so he made his own and that's what this app is.;
Boring and time wasting app a lot of time and energy waste that's way i hate it a lot 👎;
Good 😊;
loven it!;
Nice app;
Good☺️;
So nic app;
Ok But Will Be Good Future App;
Meh Twitter clone.;
Wow;
Bugs ,bugs, cannot login when you change instagram password;
You can't be the original;
Good app;
Draining the battery and the app is missing a lot of features. They force you to use Instagram account for using the app. If I want to delete the account for Threads then I have to delete my Instagram account too. Please read details of the app it may collect before U download because they collect too much sensitive informations like financial and health also others details. The app working poorly because it keeps crashing when trying to post or comment and login push notification keep lagging.;
Somebody put a blanket on Twitter logo Also if you can add tiktok in insta why can't you just add threads as a feature in insta Also not a possible growth of someone who don't use insta;
Nice app;
Felt like I'm in mix of twittah and inst, but only the worst things from these apps. Really tastes disgusting;
Good 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌;
Once upon a time, this app had the swagger of a superstar, but now it's just begging for a standing ovation from the exit door. The hype train has derailed, leaving nothing but a ghost town of deserted users in its wake. If boredom had an official spokesperson, it would be this app. Time to bid adieu to the good ol' days and embrace the exciting world of apps🐦that actually deliver on their promises!;
It's always better at first tries but later then gets boring. The interfsce is still not that smooth and the feed is messy. I always see random people on my feed even though I don't follow them.;
Launched wayy to early. Missing essential features, content is just Instagram without pictures. If it improves I might rate it higher but for now it's just too bare bones.;
Works well and it's so far a better than blue bird experience, but there's a lot of room for upgrades.... if they happen, I'll upgrade my rating;
I lovr thia app so much But there is something that i really want you to add to it I want yoi to add a place we can have conversation nov just seeing post and commenting. If its just a place we can have a private chat with ourselves and groups;
God created us. We came from Adam and Eve. They were given choice and decided to ignore God's warning. They disobeyed. They were removed from paradise and were fallen. We have the same nature as them when we are born as humans. Unless we are born again. The only way to be born again is to trust in what Jesus did on our behalf, facing God's wrath which we deserved to face even though He lived a sinless life, even to death. Forgiveness of sins is only found in Jesus's name.;
Waste of time;
So boring aap and have so many glitches;
Lizard boy;
Nice 👍 threads aap;
Boring af;
As usual, no followers no use, no one using it in the feed, despite a seamless launch for once;
Crashes all the time so what is the point;
A Twitter rip off;
Good.;
Too bad that this app has nothing original to offer;
Poor experience.;
Would be 5 star if not for the constant crashes, amazing app otherwise!;
It is a good app that fulfilled more than the minimum requirement for a social app. Congrats to Meta;
Не вижу смысла в этом приложении в принципе;
Not sure what the point of Threads is. Full of people selling stuff, anime, or people talking about Threads.;
Trash app.;
Why I have to delete my Instagram account!!!!;
Helllo;
Copy;
Very basic. Doesn't always auto follow who in your instagram list, as stated. Needs things like save, edit and a discover page, like Instagram, if it is to move forward.;
Like Twitter it's just for large corporations to say dumb things. Doesn't seem like there are any real people on here;
bad af;
garbage;
Copy of twitter;
Bad;
so bad;
Bad functionality and lacking features. Can't choose who I want to see. Poor knockoff of twitter.;
Terrible, download Twitter instead;
Title: A Game-Changer for Social Engagement - Instagram Thread App Review Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5) Review: Instagram Thread has undoubtedly transformed the way we connect and engage with others on social media. As an avid Instagram user, I am thrilled to share my experience with this remarkable new app. Instagram Thread takes the concept of storytelling to a whole new level, allowing users to dive deeper into conversations and share their thoughts in a more meaningful and organized way.;
I have had to report a system failure three separate times and I haven't received any response. I have also noticed that comments on my threads have been reported but I'm not the one that has reported them. Either I've already been hacked (it's only been about a week) or there's a lot of glitches that need to be fixed but either way I'm really frustrated with the fact that nobody has gotten back to me or even attempted to fix my problem.;
Just loved it more than how I loved twitter;
مادرت و سگ گایید;
Waste of time. Totally useless;
Would give five if it didn't keep closing when I'm trying to type a post!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;
good;
Sucks;
Since most of the people have multiple accounts on instagram, I hope it will be possible to have multiple accounts in threads too.;
Exellent💝;
Its Twitter from the trash;
Good;
🤷‍♂️🤦;
Awesome, kind space;
Twitter best;
Pathetic;
Same as twitter. But can't delete account? Likely buffing numbers or users.;
Awful;
Copy cats;
Wannabe twitter with censorship.;
I don't think this can make some damages to twitter 🤔 but I don't know what the future will be;
10/10 for the UI, it looks cool and clean. But the feed is just infested with suggested content. At least on twitter you can separate the suggested content from the content of entities that you actually choose to follow. Might have some interest in Threads if they implement this feature, but for now... Bai;
Currently, it's very challenging to use. It's in dark mode and I want to change it to brighten it up. But apparently I can only change it through Instagram? Why? Dark mode needs to be improved. It's tough on the eyes and the UI is visually unbearable. Twitter nearly perfected the UI. I think it's a decent start but I can't use it for more than a couple of seconds even if I wanted to.;
Cópia barata do Twitter que tem acesso a muitos dados de seus usuários. A concorrência ainda é melhor.;
Can't delete my account;
not Twitter bad but still really bad;
A blend of twitter & insta, but somehow worse than both of them 🤷🏽‍♂️ Maybe they'll improve features 🤞🏼;
Useless 😒;
Boring;
Lagy scrolling that ununderstandable, because it's not happening to anyone else;
Excellent;
Very laggy.;
I dont like it when it connects with my others account and now i can't delete it. Its so annoying . And dont put it on the Instagram bio . Who give you permission to not delete our Instagram acc ?.;
For me now this app before I updated it is working very well, since I update it not allowed me to Post either picture or note don't know what happened;
I enjoy the App;
it sucks;
just garbage;
Why should you be required to have an Instagram account?;
Sike;
Terrible;
Horrible search feature;
Collects unnecessary data, no free speech, looks bland, no unique features, way too basic.;
Soo baad;
I am giving it a two star because I appreciate what you'll are trying to give us,but I wished that there could be more functions available in it. Like a translation option it will help us because some of the thing in it are from a different language so to understand that we need a translation option. I look forward for more development in this application and wish that you won't ignore this review and look into the matter deeply.;
Almost identical to but even worse than Instagram if that's possible. Still can't comment pics. Who developes a social media app without pictures? A fkn lizard! That's who!;
I'm sorry Threads. The algorithm is too boring. You push too much local content. The forced contents couldn't be more different from my taste. Twitter algorithm didn't push me local content. Twitter lets me see exactly what I want. After 2 whole weeks, I guess it's time to just quit Threads. The algorithm isn't worth it if all it does is push celebrity accounts, when I was never interested with them in the first place.;
Eh is missing some things, but the bots in this app is too much.;
Sampah;
Boring. Had it for 3 days and deleted it. Waste of time and info for the advertising behemoth that meta.;
The newsfeed so random, i follow my friend, my friend follow some people then its on my timeline/newsfeed, like huh not even in my interest even not im following them, worse social app i ever downloaded.;
When I use this app I feel that I Using tweeter but the truth is it,s not twitter it,s thread ❤️;
Lol. Mark talking about privacy. Seriously? And people are using it? I mean everyone is thinking it's free so what is the problem? When your all data being displayed in dark web and one day you got a message about a unknown transaction, then you will understand.;
Last 30 days consistent upload post but not viral. This is a new app Vary big problem 😕;
Not satisfied 😔;
T&C Dalna Bhool Gaye kya Mark Bhai;
Allow users to dissociate their account from Threads. It's very cunning to only allow users to delete their threads account if they agree to delete their Instagram along.;
1.5 rounded up.;
stuck in loading;
Great copy/paste attempt by Mark/Meta but fortunately didn't succeed against Twitter.;
Do NOT install! The app is following accounts automatically on behalf of my account or sending follow request without me knowing. I don't even open the up, just receiving the notifications. Isn't that illegal Zuck??;
Delete Delete Delete;
It won't let you delete your account without deleting your instagram!;
Copycat from twitter why do I rate 5 hahahh;
Because I can't let Elon win;
Good experience;
The interface is chaotic but the app runs smooth;
Twitter is far better than threads. Zuck is cuck . Zuck made copy of Twitter just removing photos from insta.;
I feel like ppl aren't jumping on board because they felt lost or uninvolved with a higher volume of Twitter content than real news, but we'll see.. it's target is open source so maybe it'll come together if we keep what we have to say together like it's the real point;
Exact twitter copy.. Zuck even sucking at copying.;
This app very good;
Justice for Elon musk;
So buggy! My feed and updated do not load.;
Ok lang para syang thread;
Nice;
Nobody engages with your posts on this app and you are not able to delete your profile. No longer interested in using this app.;
Bad;
Nothing beats OG Hail Twitter!;
great app;
Best;
Bad;
No freedom of speech;
The app closes on its own, that's why I can't finish what I'm about to post.;
Really shameful as it copied a already existed twitter app...;
Most bare bones app;
It's literally Twitter, but from Meta. So you already know your data is not safe and there is no free speech.;
Best 🖤;
Nice 💯;
It is so smooth 😅;
Why everyone start sharing pictures on thread's;
A Liberal sh*thole. Not worth trying it. You'll be censored.;
I want to delete my thread account but when I do this thread was asking me to delete my Instagram account too.. this is a trap.. not satisfied with threads..;
Nice😃;
I do think twitter is better than this;
It's GOOD 👍;
Nice;
nice 👍;
How are the re going yo changing my information again hacker do get away buy doing what do;
Dood app;
There is no option to join without using instagram. I'm trying to limit my exposure to social media and not spend my days browsing social internet like these vultures would like you to. This was only an expression of interest, I will move on.;
Copy App 😃😃;
Fix the feeds to only ppl you follow....;
The absolute worst. Deleted it 10 minutes after downloading.;
Boring!!!!! What's the point of an social media app if you wont get any response to stuff?;
Copy and paste of twitter with out free speech😆;
Useless & a complete waste of time;
I only see posts from celebrities and news organization. I never see posts from the regular ppl I follow.;
Best of 💯;
Lack of features that supports a discussion space like tags and better algorithm. Prematurely launched.;
bad apps;
bugged ui interface.....every thing gets blurry and overlapping...please fix these bugs ASAP.;
ew i need an insta account to use it;
"Need to improve algorithm. What makes twitter interesting is their homepage can show the most random yet funny tweets from ANYONE. In threads I only saw influencer or celebrity who ""trying"" to be funny but ending up cringe.";
Great App;
Introduce poles for voting;
Wtheck is this;
Threads can never replace Twitter.;
Good;
Awesome and Amazing;
can you add a double checker when you unfollow someone because i accidentally did and its annoying;
Please add account permanently delete option...;
Good;
I love it;
This app didn't works;
Awful;
3rd class copy of twitter;
Totally Wasted..;
Worst app ever;
Being trying to post threads for 20+ hours now. But keeps saying it has failed. No customer support or where to reach to complaint.;
nice 👍;
Not engaging enough🫤;
There is no inbox option. Performance is not good.;
Ram ram bhai saab;
Zuck is a cuck;
My review can improve over time, but it needs alot of improvement... It crashes alot and shows some annoying things on my screen. Alot of un delivered post keep appearing on my screen and it's annoying.. I wish I could share my screen so you can see it;
Bad;
why does the app keep crashing when posting?;
This is op app for the Twitter users and use so let's download now;
Nice app;
Great app. Would have given a 5 star but my post keeps failing to upload for 2 days now. Pls fix or drop the android upgrade cos I see ios users talking about the new upgrade that comes with translation and other cool stuff;
Good social network. App is OK, but needs features like displaying latest threads chronologically and only from accounts you follow.;
Don't create new account and password I want to make for safe with password please why don't help me koo;
Better Than Twitter......;
Awful app, waste of time;
Meh this app sucks Twitter better;
Bad not good features avaliable pls update this features;
Copy paste (someone idea).;
The app is very good and lovely but it need some modification such as dark mode, DM, etc.;
May be Zuck should bring innovative ideas rather than copying Snapchat Twitter Tiktok features Plus the app isn't available in App Gallery;
I see posts from people I don't follow in my home timeline with no option to disable that. The promised ActivityPub support is still not available.;
Not bad;
Team Elon ❤️❤️❤️;
Great enough for me;
R.harsha;
New experience;
It disabled my Instagram account;
Unstalling it today ,;
Zero star deta agar Mera bahut ghatiya hai per bahut jyada ghatiya apne aap ki baat bolo bahut badhiya hai;
The app needs more work. It constantly fails to upload upload and barely shows most of my posts and comments.;
Not user friendly as Twitter;
I cannot get this app to send notifications and I cannot get rid of Twitter until it does. Uninstalled/reinstalled. Logged out/logged in. Played with notification settings in app and in phone settings. Turned off battery optimization for app. No notifications.;
Extremely invasive. Collects way too much data for it to be even legal. Moreover, feels like a watered down dumbed out twitter;
This is good app but it occupied lot of storage;
Go download twitter dumbasss;
Nice;
Ok ok app;
If Meta wanted to go head to head with Twitter, they should have given us a better quality app. Hidden words do not work and the home feed is nothing but the same threads all day. I'm still seeing the same threads from 6 days ago. Twitter is the superior app.;
مو حلو خالص;
👌👌👌👌;
Nice app 😊😊;
Lame, ya'll know it buh can keep up with the cope. Twitter is King;
Cool;
i dont like this app;
Bad experience;
Great;
No Controversy, and Cancellation History of Meta;
"I couldnt post or see other stuffs. The same ""failed to upload "" thing . I did reinstall the app again but it didn't work. This is not how you win over twitter";
Very fine app it's easy to use posts notifications. I like the Thread!;
Very boring app and zuck is a cuck..;
Oomy god;
What is the point of words if it does not allow me to say things i want? Also very buggy;
Bahut jyada kharab app hai;
Not sure why I installed this;
Pahle mujhe lagta tha yah bilkul useless hoga Jab Maine Se Chala kar Dekha Hoga yah to YouTube se bhi best Hai ismein future I think this like APP;
It's Soo cool;
Laggy;
codename nya decul;
Lack of features, personalised feed, etc..;
Good;
Another app to connect with people;
Que copia tan mala, si la elimino se elimina instagram.😔 Que basura sensura como todo instagram, mala Copi de twitter.;
Bahut Shandar;

Scam bc;
Best for me;
Laghbjjh;
Copied app;
Couldn't do anything in the app;
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏;
Nice;
❤️🥰;
I am facing an issue with this application. Whenever I am trying to reply or quote a video the application shuts off by itself and that video disappears. It's happening from the day one that I had downloaded threads. Please fix that problem. Thank you.;
"Nice attempt on copying Twitter but I find some things not so comfortable in this app. For example, I can't separate posts in a feed between recommendations and my follows. It's just a huge list of endless publications from people I don't know and don't care about. Also it would be great to have ""save media"" button.";
Too many red flags;
Useless app can't even see single word on screen due to glitch.everything is overlap on each other.;
Worse app;
Useless app;
at first I like it but I started having a problem. It keeps closing. I'm not even done composing my caption. I couldn't upload the photos that I wanted to post because it keeps on stopping. I refresh it, I log out and went online, I redownload the app but still I couldn't post what I wanted to post :<;
भाई गलती से download हो गया यार;
For me this is okay for me kaya bibigayan ko Siya NG 5 star rating;
Can't login my account Too much ads censorship;
Very bad;

This is TRASH Not Accessible to everyone who don't have an Instagram account;
Ths app still need a lot of improvements 💀 I Don't really enjoy using it;
Very good;
Worst app didn't understand what is the use of it;
Another Zuckerberg censorship device;
Twitter>>>>>;
Just a twitter wannabe. Nothing like giving the Zuckernerd more personal info.;
Worst app totally copy of Twitter btw Twitter>>>>>>>than curly reptile;
So boaring app dont download this;

I don't like itt and I want to uninstall threads but what can I do for that if I uninstall threads then my Instagram will also delete that's why I give only rate 1 plzz Instagram owner change this system;
Nice;
👌;
Good;
2rd copy of Twitter Zuck keyboard = copy & paste 😤😤😤;
Twitter is better you lizard 🦎;
It's pretty ok so far. If it gets better in later updates I MIGHT move from Twitter. Off the top of my head a few improvements you can make is adding a timeline for accounts you follow & let us make other customizable timelines, adding post search would be amazing. Normally I don't like Meta/Facebook products but honestly? As an artist I just want to get out of Twitter and still have a chance getting seen.;
It still lacks lots of features but there's hope for the future. I appreciate the competition it brings to the table.;
Chutia ap by mark juker tying to copy twitter;
Plz tell me, how can I log in if i m not an insta user....👎👎👎;
Too much censorship, nothing new creatively;
This app keeps on cracking;
Superb..this app and amazing things and best fuchers;
Worst;
Faltu;
Threads is g@y;
Worst algorithm I've ever seen.;
This app is really amazing and can take place of twitter;
Nice platform;
It's very easy to use .;
So bad experience Too much lag;
Mi e;
This is very similar to the bird app, but without the rampant toxicity. It works well enough, but it does feel a bit light on features. Hopefully it will become better with time. Overall, I am really enjoying Threads.;
Akil_______ak47;
I'll reinstall when you can just see people you follow instead of completely random people;
It's just a Twitterised version of Instagram. Nothing more nothing else. And after a few weeks on its full of unwanted, unsavoury, bogus, fake-ish accounts that no one wanted and no one asked for. Since signing on all I've been doing is blocking and muting accounts. And the fact that it lacks so many features up until this day. Say what you will but I would rather stay in Twitter and Instagram.;
Needs a tablet UI option;
Worst app ever. So cringe😑;
Showing a lot of promise. Just needs some added functions like the ability to search for topics you are interested in.;
waste;
Looks like cheap copy of instagram.... Not even bit closer to Twitter. Its so cheap my words cant explain it. I was excited for it but it ruined everything. Tooo cheap quality.;
Not good. You just doing copy paste of Twitter layout. do something new if you have otherwise don't waste your time and money.;
God Awful UI;
It's awful, no filters, you get banned for everything, you can look for interesting topics going back to Twitter well tbf I never left Twitter and will never do;
I have been logged out of my threads account. Please how do I reactivate it? Thank you.;
ELON MUSK BAAP HAI THREADS KA;
All fine ❤❤❤❤;
Un revuelto;
Not soo special in app;
Great;
This apps is one of the best latest app for advertising;
horrible yuck;
I tried to delete this app and it turned my friends and family against me.;
nice;
Data security nightmare;
Threads needs actual threads, currently it's closer to a simple messenger than a social media site.;
Please bring the sound in videos which I have uploaded in this app. Voice is not working. please like and follow me. Increase my followers and make my all videos viral;
Nice 👍;
"This app has filled up my timeline with profiles I don't even follow! It defeats the whole purpose of ""following""🗑️ I'm going back to twitter. If this is not changed, I'm deleting the app altogether. Nonsense!";
👌Ok;
nice;
Excellent;
Not good 😏;
Ok;
Sasta Twitter;
Lovely 😍 appp;
So bad 😞;
Don't install this app ...;
Copy of twitter;
Annoying.. why am I forced to ee random people's thoughts that I could not care less about. Twitter you follow people you are interested in. Threads you are forced garbage. Oh and can't delete once you join.;
❤️;
Fake followers trick on threads;
This feels like a copy and pasted twitter;
Cheap knockoff of Twitter. Government censorship is the main feature of this app.;
Amazing experience so far but it really needs some basic stuff like gifs etc. I really hope we see more updates soon.;
Full Copy of twitter zucky bro why you only made a copy of Apps that are exist think different.;
"So far it's pretty peaceful. I appreciate that there's a pop up telling me that I might be posting something that could be deemed a problem(even if they're wrong), instead of the way FB will just arbitrarily ban me. I am getting a ""Threads failed to upload error."" This is annoying since other apps are uploading just fine.";
Disapointing by meta 😞;
It's like Twitter but way worse;
Absolute dogpoop;
Takes forever to load new... Threads? Twits? Moderation is as senseless as in Facebook. So much for the hype.;
Last 2week;
Bad;
Update.. Still sucks after updates today July 19th. Just put it in chronological order like Twitter does and everything will be perfect I don't want to see threats from people I don't follow Seems nice but what the hell all I see is people that I don't follow I go check off thread only people I follow and yet I still see Toys R Us in my timeline like why I just want to see who I follow in chronological order of the time they send a message have the people who created this and never use Twitter?;
Excellent;
Download the app;
Dumb app , doesn't has even 10% features of twitter;
🇮🇳🙂👌🌹❔;
Enable 'create new id' instead of 'login with instagram';
So far so good!;
Useless app. Once signed in, you can't delete your account without deleting your Instagram too! I believe we should have been informed about it in advance;
Fak this appppp;
Good Working 🙂;
Stupid app;
Lots of bug... User screen is blur;
Excited;
It's just fun and easy to use compared . personally it helps have some feed for my Instagram so yay threads I would encourage anyone to download this;
Needs tweeking but it's a good start. The best thing is that it's rubbing it's nutsack across Elon Musk's racist gob and the RWNJs and Nazis aren't anywhere to be seen!;
"Si creías que era un ""Twitter killer"" pues no lo es. Es horrible, te recomiendo usar Twitter o cualquier otra aplicación.";

Automatically Locked me out of my account. Can't find a way to sign back in.;
twitter copy musk will win press yes if u agree;
Worst application ever;
server crashed again its like i am not connected to server.please fix it soon;
Pretty good for a first launch!! Its easy to use and self-explanatory and I'd say the algorithm is good as well. It has great *potential* but a few things need improvement: -the ability to use hashtags would make it easier to find topics and people you'd be interested in -an option for a following-only feed would be a major improvement (especially chronological order) -the ability to choose images from albums rather than recent photos -the ability to save photos to phone;
terrible can't create an acc without having Instagram;
It is not loading my posts saying something went wrong and suddenly shutting down while texting.. Very annoying and interesting. I cannot use it..;
Too simple;
Excellent. The UI was clean and the navigations were easy. There was few minor bugs encountered. The app was stable and the experience was seamless. Very easy to reach out to connections and people. Very similar its competitor, twitter.;
App often crashes when in the middle of writing a post losing whatever you wrote;
BEKAR HAI BHAIYA ME TO TUT GAYA🙄🙄🙄;
One word. Zuck;
Awful in every way;
Good;
Terrible. No engagement. Not even worth signing up. Make sure to uninstall it and don't leave their spyware hanging around on your phone.;
Stopped working 2 days in. 2 days and now everything I try to post or comment on just says it fails. Tried repeatedly reaching support. They basically have none as far as I can tell not that Meta is known for good customer service or anything.;
Worst app ever built in entire human history, This application doesn't deserve a single star rating.;
I didn't like the app Twitter is wayyy better;
Nice apps;
😂;
I don't want an Instagram account. I have face why not give a Facebook link also. I use to like Twitter;
It's just a cheap knockoff of Twitter;
Always giving first app updates including new features to apple phones. Against this discrimination, I have uninstalled this app from meta.;
No freedom of speech;

"Doesn't even work anymore, it was fine for about a week but at some point I could no longer see my own profile or activity, it just says ""something went wrong"" I reported it but that black box of a user support system doesn't even inform me if the report went through and no reinstalling the app didn't work";
.My life sucks because every month someone the same robs me. It's like I can't have cash because I don't write down the serial numbers maybe I should from now on like write down every serial number and when you spend it check the number and write what it was for I wish that I knew who kept stealing my money because I want to die because someone is a opertuneist and robs me when I'm in the shower suspected 1.bobbie.jo.white2.pat.david 3.roy.delormier4.island.golf 5.harley.david6.brandon.p.david;

Followed by20000people;
was enjoying, thought great an app that will replace my large Twitter one that I stopped going on because of the bs. then 1 week into it, I get suspended with no explanation other than I have violated content rules( I had not yet posted anything, only reposted) and to appeal or even open app I must enter a code sent to my phone # only it never comes. So I guess I won't be on threads;
Worst app;
You all copied Twitter in a really graceful way 🤣🤣🤣🤣;
it better than twitter;
Love this 💖😘 I will always trust you zuck;
Twetter has better than thread.;
Facebook will not commodify the fediverse. SPAM 1 STARS!;

Twitter but good;
absolutely rubbish app!;
Way too many bugs. If i change my IG password in locked out on my threads and don't have the option to simply re-enter my new password. Everytime i use the @ function to tag someone in a post the app kicks me out;
Good;
suddenly My feed is full of photos and people I don't follow .. I'm here for text not looking for another IG;
Cheap copy of Twitter.;
La copia de Twitter, con la censura de Facebook, así de fácil;

can't view just the accounts you follow, so the app is not worth using until they add that feature. at least there's block and mute buttons to somewhat curate your feed, but it doesn't help much;

Worst privacy policy! What's the purpose of this app? Not at all the alternative of Twitter! So much additions needed if this app want to become a rival of Twitter!;

Does not put info from the people you follow in your feed. You get what the app wants to show you and it doesnt do a good job at picking what you would like to see EDIT: Getting better;
A good platform for content creators;
It kept crashing, especially when writing a new thread. I was repeatedly put off because of this and closed the app entirely. Hopefully it's fixed in a future update, I'll update my review once this app stops crashing.;
I'll start by saying I've enjoyed being on threads, when I can get on it that is, as it just crashes constantly, always when I'm trying to reply to people. And the problem is it crashes, I then have to remember who I was talking to or the thread I was on and find it again. Only for it to crash again and again and again. I'm at the point where its unusable in its current state. Needs a lot of work.;
"Half of the app does not work, keep getting ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try again"". Tried clearing cache, relog, reinstall but nothing helped. Created in-app support ticket but it's gone without reply or resolution.";

Not so good. Hope it gets better with time.;
Boring app;
This is nothing but a joke! And now I have f'ng threads in my insta for the rest of the eternity!;
Super;
Does not have hash tag search option. You can't search trending hashtag. Trending hashtag must be there.. Poor Copy of twitter.;
Boring;

No thanks, Mark it trash, keep it of your own, not even close lizard man;
I like it. It's simple. The only thing i do not like is i have to see the posts of people i don't follow;
This is the best app I ever seen it's if it is already leading up wow wow wow thanks at threads;
This application is very good & Amazing;
abhi;
Too many restrictions;
Well played Mark...well played;
I can't get this ap on my laptop;
your app is flopping lmao, bondee 2.0;
Very bad;
Like Instagram;
Twitter is better;
If you delete your account in threads, the account of Instagram will be delete;
Needed to fix some bug;
I don't know how to grow account in this platform ??? If you have followers on Instagram, you will still enjoy threads otherwise no entertainment & no like on your profile;
Bad;
You failed suckerberg. Twitter way better.;

Worst app all thing copied from Tweeter Snapchat 😒 not some different so frustrated;
"Getting ""Sorry something went wrong. Try again."" error on all tabs except the post tab(works fine).";
This is a very good app I like it;
Its not as good as Twitter It has intellectual community Uninstalling now..;
Nice;
Just a copy of no worth.;
Worst;
nice;

Its good and wasy to use. The design is simple and understandable unlike other apps that just have all the things jumbled up. I like it.;
"It's an unnecessary product and looks so overloaded and I don't like ""some"" types of people here saying anything about anything. Useless, period.";
I thought it's a chating app but problem we can't delete because my insta I'd will deactivate 😔😔;
It's good but please add GIF !!;
Love at first sight! Just have a small suggestion: Can you add a feature to save Threads just like saving posts on IG. I think like I'm missing a lot while scrolling.;
Not good app;
A hundred failed threads per bolt because the people using them felt like they were thrown into a dry desert, the man who owns meta is the most ignorant man in the world because he didn't ask himself what is the purpose of threads. threads will go where google + went;
Too many pictures on the feed very very few actual threads;
Threads is not easy;
Boring;
I love you;
A very bad experience;
Make a way to uninstall this app without losing Instagram data very soon.;
Awesome;
Please promote me id;
F*** Elon;

Nice thread 👍;
"Your policy meant nothing. I cant uninstall this app as my account is interlinked and ""will delete my account if uninstalled"". Dear Meta, please change your policy. If not, its your loss that this app has 3.0 ratings...";
I love Elon Musk ❤. So without installing or using it, giving 1 star ⭐ to this copycat 👇👇;
Useless app;
Useless app with no base or proper content or creative team;
boring;
I believe that this app has potential, but there are a few features missing that would make the experience better. One feature that should be implemented is an explore tab, where you can find threads from people you do not follow. There could also be a tab that shows you popular threads at the time.;
Waste of time;
Mja a gya ❤️😍;
What i want is not there is just basically tweet from accounts i follow on Instagram;
Nice but add a trending page and hashtags;
Trash;
Viable Twitter alternative. However, continually shows threads of people I don't follow. There are no settings to change this. This makes it essentially unusable 🤷‍♂️;
I'll download this app when I can chat on it 😏;
Highly censored platform zero free speech.;
This app is not working well on my phone. It's repeating the writing on the screen, the app look exactly like twitter though.;
Reels hoti or massager hota to mja aa jata;

Excellent application 👍 posting massage any opsnal good;
Chotte Mark Zuckerberg.;
Very annoying with that very Instagram feature where it thinks it knows better than I do and shows me posts from people I don't follow. Stop it! And if you want to ve a twitter alternative give us a chronological timeline and stop showing me people I don't follow. Up to the minute info is what newshead use twitter for;
Worst app;
Nonnnn;
Love the interface but the app keeps on crashing. I also opted not to sync my instagram contacts to threads so I can have a fresh start of choosing who to follow but it keeps on suggesting/showing too many accounts in its home tab.;
Would be a lot better if there was a chronological order and a what's trending in the world so if an event happens users will be able to see it in real time.;
Pretty boring with cringe leadership;
Nice;
Aaminsidik ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍;
Meh, 50/50;
Twitter ripoff.;
You can't save photo, video in this app.It lacks one of thr most basic thing.;
Would have been nice to also know how many views a post has. I think that'd be a really good thing to add;
Worst Copy ever!!!;
Good;
Its useless;
Worst app.;
Not saport in mi note 5 and 6;
another meta app stealing data and private info even without option to opt out, its no replacement for Twitter, and should be banned;
Need to be able to change between accounts in app.;
Twitter was better when first released.;
Don't install!!!;
Features are non existent. Literally I don't know how this has 50 million downloads. Nobody is on it at all and my feed isn't anybody in following. Alot is to be desired.;
Love the app ... One thing I would like is the volume on the videos being easier to select as on .. and once it's on for one, stays on for all until I turn it off. Also, I know they have more to come like better search features. Oh, and if I could see more of who I follow on my feed, rather than your 'suggestions' ... That would be nice 👍 If you are Threads development reading this, I'm using Android,... Oh and GIFs. I have to use an app, save them and post them rather th. The keyboard on my 📱;
Total trash.;
Nice;
Nice;
Needs a lot of improvement...app crashes on my android..;
Can't see any replies to any threads. It always says something went wrong;
Has a long way to go, why release something that clearly has many problems but guess it was released to clobber other such apps.?;
Trash;
I could have done without this. It's basically Twitter for your Instagram. Listen, that's great but none of what I'm seeing on my main feed is stuff from people I follow. It's just a bunch of useless stuff. Please make it so I only see stuff from people I follow.;
❤️;
Absolutely horrible. Within minutes my freedom of speech was sensored.;
I don't need suggestions .i wanna see what i want .not what the app showed me;
Worst copy to imitate the the users of Twitter;
I hate that we need to login with an Instagram account. I don't want an Instagram account, poorly developed!!! The proper way to develop this is by creating a main Meta account, and using SSO to login each app. In your Meta User settings, the user should be able to choose which apps their Meta account can access, so they should be able to activate or disable FB, IG, Horizon, and Threads.;
It's blocked in the EU. Apart from that also I have read comments about crash and so on. Probably, Threads owners started in the wrong moment. Being patient always brings quality.;
Good;
It's Twitter. It's literally just Twitter. If you like Twitter this is fine. If you hate Twitter you'll hate this. Simple as that.;
Delete your threads account, you will loose your Instagram. Really ?! F...K Instagram;
feed of junk, goodbye;
Gay app;
I wasnt getting notifications for my messages, I turned off this app and I started to get audio notifications...;
Sure, there will be some issues with a new app. Including features that others are demanding. Give the team some time please! Threads is already superior than other similar platforms.;
Kind like a Twitter knockoff and really just an extension of Instagram vs anything new.;
A lot like both Instagram and Facebook; Useless.
Threads and Instagram are practically the same thing,the only difference is that threads is limited to posts and photos,the only thing missing to make it Instagram is messaging,reels etc. Not everyone will agree but it's practically the same as Instagram. This is my opinion;
Não consigo fazer um post, sempre da erro;
Refreshing!;
Need more features that twitter doesn't have;
Not good;
Best;
Good app;
bloody apps its disconting dont Download or use this apps because its waste your time.;
So buggy. Gets stuck like every 2 minutes. Not recommended;
Its cool but here are some issues i see. First off you have no hashtags, you cant search topics, no dm feature, you cant add a backdrop picture. First week you could share a link and the thumbnail would show. Today it only show the link in preview and then minimizes to just the link when posted....something people are less likely to click on. Some people are not dealing with that issue. Cant claim you have an app that will allow more EXSPOSURE and things like that are missing or glitching out.;
Twitter better;
we don't need anything like Twitter;
अभी यह नया ऐप है पर धीरे-धीरे लोगों को अच्छा लगेगा Very good app;

Hello sir;

This is a great app thanks developers;

Easy to use;
This is a great application;
Stupid and useless app i have been restricted from following people, 4days this and yet still i can't follow people. It's like i have been ban from Threads;
"All pages expect the main timeline now leads to ""Something went wrong, please try again"".";
Great 👍 👌;
Good;
Exllent;
Ni,,,,,,,;
😕🫣🫣;
Very poor app. Do not support stealing ideas from others. Didn't expect this from Meta.;
The app seems to be a simplified version of twitter, and as someone who had always Found twitter too convoluted to use, it's perfect.;
Better than twitter;
There's no feature to explore people's tweet, homepage is just a bunch of random celebrities instead of people who i followed, no hashtag feature. Big big no.;
You need to have an IG account to create a threads account. That is dumb.;
I can't update my app;
Horrendous;
"""Sorry, something went wrong."" I've deleted the cache, reinstalled the app, reset my connection; nothing's worked. Shame. I like the app, unfortunately I have not been able to use it for over a week. Cannot do anything besides scroll the timeline because I keep getting the error.";
Best app from Mark Zuckerberg the meta Man 👞;
Thread inspired by Twitter😏;
péssimo;
I Want To Like it! I just find it really annoying that I keep seeing posts from people I don't follow or things I'm not interested in on my feed MORE than posts from the people I do follow and actually want to see and I have no way of stopping it from showing up. It has potential to be such a good app.;
Worst app don't use it;
Copy 🐈;
So cute;
👍👍👍 Twitter se bahut accha hai ye aapp;
Top;
Too many glitches and blocks you from likes and follows for adding people from Facebook and IG bc it thinks you're a spam acc if u happen to have too many friends.... also doesn't show any people you really follow just celebrities and politicians 🙄;
Very bad censorship;
It is 👍;
Boring;
Basta ka gagamit ko lang okay naman as of the moment;
Not intresting 😔;
Won't let me follow anyone, 8 days now and the response from Threadsapp team non-existent. Other than that, i like the communuty and the app is getting better, but has a long way to go.;
Yarr once you logged then you can't remove data if you remove i'll remove from insta gram so i worried about it;
It's better than Twitter;
Was pretty good but now it crashed every few minutes, would be 4 stars if it worked;
Excellent 👌;
too much fake users.;
The app has been amazing since the first day. 😍 and the people who said it crashes 0r overlaps threads and stuff are the hater's;
I am not getting any new posts while on home icon. My feed has the same posts that he had about a week ago with nothing new added.;
A copy;
"The best explanation for a ""threads app"" refers to a software application that enables users to engage in threaded conversations or discussions. In the context of computer programming and software development, a threads app typically involves the use of multithreading, a programming technique that allows a single process to execute multiple threads concurrently. Here's a more detailed explanation: Threaded Conversations: In the context of social media or messaging platforms, a threads atreder";

daleep_408. My insta id please help me growing and i am using threads app😁;
Only inside...;
Nice grow the app 👍🏻👌🏻;
My biggest issue with threads is that it's next to impossible to find posts from people you actually follow! My timeline is filled with people I've never heard of or celebrities that I don't care for.;
Please introduce data saving. This app uses way too much data just for tweets. I don't need videos to load or high quality images;
"Why always keep saying ""sorry, something went wrong, try again later.."" It's annoying.";
I love it 🥰❤💥;
Not good;
Scrolling through the content is not so smooth;
your data is at risk with zuck.;
it was amazing;
nothing will load and can't change my bio;
"it always says ""something went wrong""";
It's a bad copy of a bad app by a desperate company. Zero stars!;
It's ok. Not something I need at the moment. You follow the same people as you do on insta and you share the same content so what's the point.;
Good Ok fine;
Competition is good but not cheating;
Very shady privacy practices. Can't even delete your account without also deleting your Instagram account.;
Just stop 🛑;
The app is amazing but I recommend u add a dms feature;
Are love this app;
I cant post threads on my insta story or feed and i cant see how much reach i got;
I'm happy with this app. I want to unhide badge of threads on instagram also there is not other option for bring it back so i request you work for it asap. I appreciate your work. Please understand my concern.;
so far so good. a few days ago the app would keep shutting down, but uninstalled and reinstalled and that fixed it. Gotta add a way to go back and edit threads for spelling and revisions. Once its posted no way to change/modify what u posted...😕;
Ui = 💩;
Need to improve.Same as Twitter;
waste app don't download this app! My 1 star only this app logo;

It was very good!!!! You should add the feature by which we can download post and videos from someone's thread.;
Useless twitter half fake brother app Meta can't you be more innovative? Copying twitter features?;
There is actually no purpose of this app except being professional here and casual at fb.;
Bro literally copied Twitter and thought we wouldn’t notice😭;
It's a great app but boring tbh. Hoping to improve it more!!;
👎🏾;
Wow that was for very interesting app;
Slow, glitchy, and constant crashes! Whenever we try to post something it always ends up in the limbo, garbage experience! Update: no basic features even after month of launching, and glitches and slowness is still same, can't upload anything because it ends up in the limbo, no wonder why this app is losing the game against twitter.;
❤️❤️;
This apps useless and has broke instagram (causing crashes), stick to what youre good at;
Great but needs a trending tab, and a sfw feature. It is not sfw.;
So boring;

So many garbage accounts on here. I spend most of my day blocking & muting accounts that it is getting tiring.;
Great;
This app keeps saying get ready for threads and nothing happened so I'm not holding my breath or anyting or trying to be disrespectful but was supposed to happen I keep waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and it just keeps saying wait are you ready for threads are you ready for threads I get some build up to some great thing like somebody needs to fix whatever is going on in this piece of s*** have it right get it tight or get this s*** off my site and outta my damn site;
Good but Urgently need the messaging and audio conversation room like Twitter spaces 😕;
The best app in the game by a light year;
Garbage copy of twitter;

It asked me to logim with Instagram but I don't have any Instagram account. It should have options to sign up using phone number or email id. This app is a cheap version of Twitter.;
Just a bunch of left wing bots;

better than twitter for sure! more safe and inclusive.;

Maybe could be the best than Twitter 🙄;

It's just garbage;

Good.... We need web version of this;
Literally a copy of Twitter 🤢🤮;
Nice app;
This is very alternative for the blue bird app. It's actually fun and less toxic but there's some features that are still missing 1. Following Tab, as much as I like seeing people's threads, I wanna see the one I followed. 2. Hashtags, I mean if you wanna trend something you gotta use that. 3. Trending, I'm sorry I'm so used to looking at what's the trends ATM 4. Functional Search button. Not only the person you can search but pretty much everything;
"So is this app available in the EU or not? Because I was able to download it and follow a bunch of pages just fine, but now it's just ""something went wrong"" all the time. What's up?";
Oklah;
Bhai main sabko support karta hun mujhe bhi support karo Himanshu lakhera ap YouTube id;
cannot even create an account;
Naigh;
Nice application;
I installed that day when it launched. It's similarly Twitter and attractive app and totally nice;
"""Sorry, something went wrong. Try again. "" My entire threads experience.";
Worst app;
So many issues. I couldn't see my own profile page, other people page, my replies, notifications, etc. The only thing working for me is the feed, which filled from a bunch of accounts I'm not following. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still runs into the same problem. I'm using Google pixel pro.;
App sucks twitter is better.;
OP pro;
I love the app so far But they should please put the dm option for us;
Extremely poor. Just copied twitter. World don't need this app.;
Off brand Twitter fraud and scam used on this app;
Copied the concept of Twitter under Meta umbrella. Needs to be more innovative.;
A trap for instagram users if you download this you then can't delete this account or your insta account will be also deleted.;
It's ok. The post and feed are not loading. It's been like this for a few days now.;
New app new technology;
Very bad;
IT'S COMING FROM TOKYO WAY WXIII PATLABOR THE MOVIE 3 2002 SPRING;
Threads gives a sets a perfect example that if you product is poor, no godly amount of money on advertisement will help you make that business thrive. Threads is that poor products, who had Instagram to promote it but it failed badly coz it was just dogshit and unnecessary app;
Boring;
Kindly provide an option to login without an Instagram account.;
Best app;
Twitter 8/10 Threads 2/10;
Good I love it;
It's good and ok hope it will save us from harsh Twitter rules;
Copyyy;
Elon Musk Chacha Zindabad;
"When I joined threads there were only 12 persons already downloaded I was on 13th to download it this is good app right now but there must should be option for translation any vintect wriiten on the post .There should be same features like Instagram ""Insights"" etc.";
😩😩;
Great app but add an option to create account without Instagram. I like threads but I hate using Instagram.;
saikishore349;
useless app no hashtags feature,no freedom of speech because you can also block any account, no direct message, big pictures like it is Instagram not microblogging app.;
👍;
Bakwas;
Its really nice;
Very bad 😡😡😡;
Nice app better than twitter;
Good 😊 Great 💫;
Elon will win;
Worst app;
Beat elon;
Useless;
Ruim!;
Under 👇👇👇👇 It is copy write;
Dis like;
Copy;
Copy of Twitter;
Love how there's no ads ... yet. Reminds me of old chat rooms in the 90s. It'll get better!;
Nice apps;
தெளிவு. அருமை;
I really love this app, but dear Devs, please help: I was in the zone with the bad internet, where I got an error saying that the feed cannot be loaded. But when I came home, the problem didn't disappear. And unfortunately, I still cannot post for some reason, see my threads and likes. I cleaned cache, reinstalled the app, checked the network access. How can I solve this?;
Trash;
Kindly Add Dark Theme;
Stripped down, zero ads, focused, clean, and overall very positive. Having a lovely time.;
This app is very good to use because this app got 50M+ Users in 1 month this app upload on 1 may 2023;
Just trash. Absolutely pointless app, and now I can't delete my account without losing my Instagram.;
Same as every other social media.;
For Instagram people not for twitter people;
"there's no ""create account"" button?? it just says ""log in with Instagram"" i don't have instagram";
My experience has been of half naked tasteless woman and perverted men and I will be discouraging anyone to use it... Matter of fact I have posted my horrible experience on social media... I will try to make it go viral;
Another way of extracting data and making the user useless in life;
Apk nya kek twitter sii, suka tpii gk ada filtur terjemah gituuu??? kasi fitur translete yayayayaaaaaa sebenarnya nih yaa kalo ada fitur translete nya aku kasi bintang 5 tapi sayang nya gak ada si jadi kasi bintang satu;
👎👎;
This is my mine you know that;
Whay not working??;
🤙😉😍;
Worst social media app ever;
I'm enjoying it, but desperately needs hashtag support and why aren't URLs showing the featured image associated with them anymore? Without that, it's basically just Instagram and we don't need two of those.;
Just a cheap copy of Twitter It is like twitter but then also notthing like twitter;
To be honest I'm enjoying this app but the fact is the restriction is too much when ever you follow someone then they restricte ur account it very bad. Let take it that this is a new app so we are all strangling to get followers and it not easy I think you should take down the restriction down for now;
Exactly like Twitter in a sense of posting thoughts, feelings, memes, and promotions, but different in a sense that I have yet to see any pop culture drama, I have yet to see any discrimination, or cyber-bullying. Threads is safe so far!!;
Copy paste 😁;
This app is really great, anyway How do I translate other languages ​​to English? Is there an option for that in the app?;
terrible and pathetic;
Worst;
Very poor organization;
amo o Twitter 😅;
Worst;
Not good app, getting boring and lagging in many aspects;
Great 👍;
Don't get the purpose. F Boring;
This app doesn't even have good features! It just got fame due to Twitter's outage. App UI is horrible! Doesn't even have stuff to do in here. Only good thing is that it uses your Instagram ID as login and you have the option to follow all the people you followed in Instagram, that's a neat feature! APP WILL DIE WITHIN 6 MONTHS!;
Really usefulness 😇;
"It would be great if I were able to follow back people. Their ""spam trap"" has me as a false positive. I have submitted a support ticket 3 times & replied to their Thread about the problem several times, but no response. It's beyond frustrating and I'm almost ready to delete my account. If the problem gets fixed, I'll add more stars to my rating and change my review.";
Not soo... good the followers have very hard...not like Instagram...🙂;
Vart bad app;
Imagine twitter but with way more instagram tweens in there.;
No hastag and they delete my review how to give 0 stars;
i don't know, it isn't like Twitter;
❤️‍🩹🥰🥰;
I did not find any interesting things inside thread no # hastag trending #nocurrent news it's all about not competition it has to be about best out of others as well;
I like it 🙂 this is new one slowly get new features soon I was waiting for that's;
Past few days, if I try to share a link to an article, instead of it looking like it should, with a preview image & headline, all that shows up is a truncated URL.;
A very Cheap knockoff of Twitter....;
RajeevRaj556;
Please download video fechar come Beck this application for threads;
Wow;
This app is useless;
Data laundering 😹👎;
Good 👍;
Naàs;
-5 Start... Useless...;
Twitter best;
1 star because i have a twitter account..!;
বালো;
Nice;
Now this thread giving threat I thought it would be nice but now it became same place like insta with so much drama 😂;
"Can't post with any attachments.. tried everything...reinstall..tiny images..clear cache..just won't post. ""Failed"" eveytime... plz do a desktop version too.";
Copy Cat;
Display overlaps with old, scrolling doesn't work;
not usefull;
Nice app 👌 👍;
Good;
I just change password from my ig account, and I can't re-login on threads. Even if I tried to logged out and re-login ig 2 times still can't access threads.;
Copy of twitter 😂😂😂 cheap app cheap thinking;
I would rate it a 5 if mark can win the cage fight. Lets go.;
Ok;
Copy;
I love those app thanks Mr meta;
Worst app;
Crashes on photo upload every single time. If I attempt to upload a photo from my Fuji X-T5, the app crashes. Phone photos work fine.;
2 weeks since I installed.not opened more than thrice😭;
Very clean ui structure;
Copy;
Give space to other apps don't make monopoly and I comfortable with Twitter.;
Apply the option of threads to the home page of Instagram;
When I log in to instagram, the threads log out. Vice versa. Because of this, my instagram was violated and I couldn't interact with my friends.I can't even comment, like or follow. Fix this issue because I can't open my threads, because I might log out of my instagram again and increase my violation.;
Tq. @ mate;
😘😘😘;
App is not working properly because of bug 🪲;
Why is it showing you've been logged out of %1$s.the account owner may have changed the password man I haven't done it I tryed everything uninstalling & clearing cache what more am I supposed to do man just fed up;
Bad algorithm, no one wanna see cringe influencer. No thrending;
No one wants censorship on peoples thoughts;
Knock off of twitter and part of the matrix no thanks;
Jjg;
"This is way better than Twitter. But, I have an issue, it's not ""smooth"" enough, idk what it is. Also needs dark mode";
very good🔥🔥;
👍👍👍;
Fantastic features and easily understandable;
Jivankumar;
Excellent 👌;
Yes, because, the blots on humanity Twitter, Facebook, IG, TIkTok weren't enough. We were clearly in need of another nuisance of a text based social app, from a cancer of company called Meta.;
Edvedzxxsxz ok evl oqne to eer ceme;
Not interesting platform.;
Sometimes I can't comment, it keeps telling me post failed to upload;
Its a trap don't download it;
Use less Thing;
Not working;
Awesome 😎😎;
Boycot;
Worst move by Zuckerberg. And I don't know how to delete my id .;
Third copy of twitter.;
Very irritating app;
Good;
Nice ui and all;
Elon bro;
Copy paste twitter 😁😁;
Best App;
Threads is so fun :D;
oy bilə bomba kimi di indi yükləyirəm😈🤰🤰🤰;
Not interested 🤮 copy of Twitter;
Unnecessary copy of Twitter No free speech;
total waste;
Copy of Twitter 😒;
Way worse than Twitter. Too many restrictions. You cant do this, you cant add that. Not user friendly.;
🤮;
I am destroyed 😭. Main tabah ho gya bhai ekdum bekar hai. Mere 2.5 GB data me se 2 GB videos autoplay hone ke wajah se khatam tata bye bye ho gya. Koi to Zuckerberg ko batao ki sabke paas unlimited data nahi hota. Please Data saver la do. Main aapse haath jod ke gujarish karta hu autoplay band kar do.🙏🏻😭;
Can't we use it without Instagram.;
Copy;
Very bad app it is trash!!!;
Best apps more than Twitter or other social media;
Good App 👍🏻 But Twitter 🔥💯;
Nice 👍;
After a while it's boring;
Waste of time and energy;
for me, this app better than the blue one 🤷‍♀️;
Not perfect but could be great if they begin minor improvements like hashtags and more comprehensive search. Runs really smooth and UI is clean and simple. Hopefully it doesn't get too bloated and busy like Instagram. A lot better than the cess pool that is Twitter.;
Ok;
Poorly launched;
Mast app hai bhai log;
An excellent app to waste your time.;
Waste of time;
Very nice app. But it doesn't function properly on my phone. It glitches;
Copied too badly!!;
Bagundhi 🤙🤙;
Not good;
Just a copy of twitter.;
No need to copy other app.;
Worst social media app ever!;
😈;
Twitter se to bahut achha hai ,bhagwan ne sun Li meri ,meri hmesha se ek ichha thi ki Twitter jaisa koi doosra app aaye jise me chlau .🤣🤣🤣🤣;
Threads is a great alternative to Twitter.;
Worst... Copy of Twitter;
This is a cheap copy of Twitter;
Worst user experience.........why need this application when we get free speech on Twitter?;
Worst social media ever;
I like this application but overall it's empty.... Don't have any interesting post or feeds.;
Soo bad🫥🫥;
If we made an a/c nd later if we delete it.. our both Instagram a/c nd threads will be deleted togther...;
It's an copy of twitter and not an better platform like twitter;
Waste app have been installed for days but rarely opened it ,going to uninstall;
Maludyapur;
Noob app;
why this app exist i still can't figure out what should i do in this app;
the immediate update should definitely be about adding hashtag function. also search option should be expanded so we can see not only other people's profiles, but also the content itself and hashtags;
Trash just like it's owner;
Boring;
Ladchat app galti se download ho gya aab account delete karunga to insta bhi delete ho jayega isliye saale ko 5 star rating de raha hu😕;
Very pathetic app;
Indian app Koo is best;
not increase followers bakwas app..insta bhi use karo yebhi kro..not logical only data waste and time also..;
Why should I use this? I don't understand the purpose of this. Twitter is a killer.;
F u zuck;
Elon>>>;
I felt this app is yet another time waste, with no particular use case other than bringing down Twitter and does it provide a healthy competition to improve Twitter....hell nooo;
👍;
I keep getting restriction without doing anything I don't know why you should just let thread be a different app, this app has too many buggs it is refusing to open I don't know why....;
❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌈;
Good;
It is very basd;
Stupid App;
I wanted to love it. I was hoping it would be a twitter killer. But it's just Facebook 2.0. My entire feed are people I don't follow. I actually struggle to find the posts from those who I do follow. It's about 1 in 20 threads that are people I want to hear from. It's just a mess.;
Dinesh;
This is not unique as same to insta;
Twitter > threads;
It's was good but initially I started having issues I can't comment or post show me error;
Instagram best bat threads not 🚫🚫 best;
Very bad not good features.;
I installed it to rate it.;
Don't know the purpose of this app 🤔 even they don't know what to do now;
Nice 👍;
NO US APP;
Very bad;
What is the profit of download this app I don think so any profit while there ..;
Quite new app. Have some issues but overall amazing. I'm giving 3 for now. But I'm sure in future they will improve the features so we will give 5 stars.;
copy of Twitter 🗿;
Boring;
Copy paste app;
Innovate something you theifs;
Nice app;
tpa;
Excellent, but need more user friendly features;
Good but could be better;
Can't delete theses without a decades worth of pictures on Instagram being deleted too(deleting 1 requires deleting both);
Good app;
Copy paste Twitter;
Not gonna bet on it as in the near future it will be bloated with instagram esque features.;
Disgusting 🤢🤢;
Twitter >>>;
Account verified hona chahiye;
The user interface is not good. This is ultimately an unwanted attempt. Build something new fellas. This can never replace or outperform Twitter in any manner.;
Perfect for people who want to be more authentic and less curated.;
This is not good app;
Nice;
App name could have been better.;
Trash version of Twitter;
Very good;
GUI is Great;
useless copy of twitter;
Just cpy in twitter and not secret you can'r delete account;
Boring 😔;
Useless app;
Bas eski ek problem hai ki esme ham reel nhi dekh skte or baki sab shi hai;
Ok ok;
Lucky 315;
Provide an (accept all / confirmed all ) option to accept followers request for open account on treads like Instagram ( anyone can follow open account without admin confirmation). If an account have followers in thousands or millions then what will he/she do ? . Should he/she click on confirm option for thousands or millions times to accept followers request;
Problem #1.) censorship. Problem #2.) Owned by Meta. Meta doesn't realize, it's going to go bankrupt soon! Censorship and cancel culture does not sell! These applications are not for facts, they are for entertainment. Releasing applications in 2023 that control the information that you post, is extremely harmful for democracy and freedom of speech. On that note, you can literally say J. Biden cured cancer and they won't ban you. But!, You go against their narrative they shut you up like Nazis..;
Em nice 👍🙂;
It basically Sells your soul to third parties;
Ye Hai Asli App;
Twitter is better than Threads;
I don't find anything interesting in this app;
Totally disgusting 🤮🤮🤮 aap;
Nice 👍;
Not good this app close this app Twitter is best;
It hasn't worked for me in weeks. I can see the feed but I can't post or see interactions. Already uninstalled logged out cleared cache ect. No answers my malfunction reports. They're just IT tickets sitting in limbo;
Need to fix the bugs on the app. Can't load my profile, can't make a post, can't refresh my page. Also, maybe consider allowing users to download media straight from the timeline;
After using for many days i reconsider my 4 star and I will now give this app 1 star if I could give 0 stars i would gived this app become cringe day by day no creativity in their threads i dislike this app so much just shutdown it;
Very disappointed,first of all we can't logout,then when I am opening Instagram the app keeps automatically logout;
Literally a copy;
😒👎;
Really pathetic app, can't even share my YouTube video link properly only link showsup and the thumbnail doesn't. I was showing up a couple days ago but now it's just the link. They should sync the facebook link debugger for threads as well.;
Most boring place....;
Good;
Twitter !!;
replica of twitter;
Youthless app 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎;
Not as good as twitter;
Bad app;
Worst app i swear;
Oye oye oye oye heavy duty only in social media. We have no work to do else 😕;
Great app. Abhi agile development ho raha hai iss karan se shuruaati features bs aaye hai. Jismein kaam chal Raha hai. Baad mein advanced features bhi aayenge jaise image download aur most hated ADs.;
It's amazing...;
worst;
LOWEST APP EVER;
झंड;
Hlo my favourite singer sidhu moosewala My love mom dad;
Not better than Instagram obviously;
Can't see the comments to any post, even reinstalled the app. It says. Sorry, something went wrong. Try again;
Elon wins;
This is very usefull app;
Twitter is The best 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻;
Great app 😄;
All the post are overlapping its like an hallucination worst app .;
🗿;
Nice app;
Great app;
Too much hanging;
Good 👍 👍;
It's good to use;
Copy of Twitter but not interesting like that;
Sharing a link is a terrible experience. In the preview it captures photo attached with the post, but it disappears immediately thereafter.;
This platform will always be cucked.;
Very nice 🙂;
App is overall good but you have to click everytime on 🔇 to get the video sound. This is too much irritating. I want sound version like insta. There we didn't need everytime click on sound to play sound. Everything is good 👍 Solve my problem & I'll change my review to 5⭐. Thank You!;
Boring;
The best;
Mack you are the best man;
عالی;
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳;
Deepk rana;
Not too good or different, just average and boring.;
Super;
very good 🍾;
"It tells me, ""Sorry something went wrong. Try again"" anytime I try to post or see my profile or anyone else's. I've tried everything to fix it. The app is currently useless.";
Nice app;
Bekar h;
This app collecting so many datas including browsing data location everything be alert if any body use this application please read privacy policy;
Great app very good app;
Poor imitation of twitter sans the features to back it. Given, it has raked in app installs, good growth hack piggybacking on instagram but the user engagement isn't to write home about. Uninstalled after a day.;
Copycat of Twitter. Nothing novel, nothing innovative. Waste of space and bandwidth.;
Ganmari application hai;
💞💞💞;
I can't access my timeline coz it always appeared that something's wrong;
clone;
मैं भारत से हूं और मुझे देख कर दुख हो रहा है कि Threads पर भारत का कोई यूजर नहीं है मैं भारत से हूं आप मुझे फॉलो कर सकते हैं My Instagram I'd :- Rame6patel;
😭;
👌;
I think it is better application, Because of the apk owner is also better, Elon Musk;
Elon Musk;
Very bad... Do not installed... Worst app... Lose Your internet...;
After a week of usage i found that this app sucks .;
One more time waste application by meta.;
Rubbish can't sign up or get in as I'm not on Instagram;
Nothing new;
It's great if you're comfortable giving Zuckerberg and therefore the Feds via backdoor, access to every activity, keystroke, every last bit of data (meta or otherwise ) and every piece of personally identifying information in real time . For the purposes if selling information about you to advertisers so they can better persuade and predict your next purchase and squeeze every last bit of value from that data by auctioning it off to the next data broker.;
Nice pic;
Bakwaas;
Good;
Not useful. Redundant. Can't understand why they developed it.;
Not good as twitter🙂;
It's really bad 😭😭😭 And hacking in your life;

Too many Data collection...only data miner app...Dont install;
Can't delete this account;
I am the 300000 one whom zukerbeg paid for review;
No smooth app;
Interesting but simler to the Twitter;
Any potential thia app once had may have been wasted. Meta clearly rushed this app out the door without giving time to plan out and release updates at a good rate. It is ridiculously hard to grow on the app or see posts your actually intrested in. They don't even have an actual discovery tab or following tab. The apps been out for weeks now and has had virtually no changes. The lack of updates has killed any fun this app once had.;
ممل;
We didn't know how it is , I want to see how it work;
Heavily censored woke trash. Use Twitter; support free speech.
Nice app ☺️👍;
This type many apps in playstore and google please create social media tracking apps so that can help people this type doesnt help to any;
Logging issue;
Good;
This app without dark mode is just very irritating 😫 Bring it on man or are just busy practicing for the cage fight 😐;
Simply not working. My internet connection is working fine but the app just keep loading. Tried to uninstall then reinstall but the problem persisted.;
A kinder place than twitter;
Nice;
There's still a lot to fix in this app. The unnecessary restrictions are just too much and it's making the app look a lot like a child's play...;
Super;
Be Good.;
Log in via Instagram only? But it's for adults, business Entrepreneurs... I don't have and won't have Instagram, I don't have time for that;
Very very nice app and good luck work;
Ganda;
I don't have Instagram account. Unable to login with others social networks like Facebook... Finally uninstalled the app.;
App achcha nhi hai kuch samajh nahi ata kharab not interested this app maine to ye app install karke delete kar diya;
Please fix Instagram bugs then we will Use threads i have reported many times nearly 25 to 30 times there is bug fixed in my instagram iam boared to use it in that ur saying to use threads lol fix Instagram bugs please;
Faltu hai;
Q MO MO MO o I nominees to the public criticize that we we are looking forward at you the same same way thing that we are in your prayers as you can see this this morning in regards of God we have met your new;
💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️;
Bakwas;
Very nice 👍 App;
😍😍😍;
Twitter better.;
There is need to be another way where we can login like Google ID.;
So far so good.;
I think dark mood option would be better;
My account can't found after i use this threads 😞;
A lot better than Twitter. But it would be better if you didn't have to log in with Instagram;
It's good app But it should have some features like when i post any thread it have option like 1. Post to public 2. Post to public + friends 3 post private. Then definitely thread app will overcome Twitter 👍🏻;
Waste. Twitter is better than this sh##;
Plz release a lite version;
Terrible. Censorship anti free speech. Algorithm is not open source, not relevant, nor interesting. Inflated artificial activity because it's tied to Insta. Meta does not value privacy, to them you are the product. App requires too many permissions.;
Nice app;
Mast hai;
very will I appreciate this app lounge man❤😍;
Horrible. No one needs another toxic social media app. Take your questionable and harmful privacy policies plus data selling machines elsewhere Mr. Zuckerberg.;
NYC;
🥴;
I don't understand this app!;
Threads is great! It's Twitter 2.0 and looks to only get better.;
Best app;
why?why? what's the point of a text based platform?when you are allowing the user to use it just like instgram;
such a buggy app... videos don't play sounds;
The lack of options when it come to seeing unwanted content you are not following is annoying. If I like certain things the app will bombard me with a bunch of similar content that I'm really not interested in. I try with this app but it got more and more frustrated as I keep on using it. I really wish there was an option to block certain things in my timeline not just in replies.;
Twitter Copycat.;
Theres still more that needs to be done, I love the idea of a meta intagrated social spsce but the UI still lacks that flare and i need to be able to control my feed in the near future;
Doesn't allow login without Instagram account.;
Very good;
التطبيق جيد ولكن يجب ان يصبح متواجد تحديثات تميز التطبيق عن تويتر;
I see that Twitter is better;
So many lacking features that need to be integrated. Even I updated the app already it's still lagging.;
Pay to win 😜;
Had to uninstall the app after it refused to open.;
Sucks. Staying with Twitter.;
Bad;
Good framework, needs features ASAP;
Serious lack of basic features. I had to crawl back to Twitter. Also, you can't delete it lest you delete your Instagram account, beware. Do not get this app unless you are content with losing every other app account owned by Meta;
Dollar store Twitter;
Nice 🙂🙂🙂🙂;
Twitter fans in push and send 1 star from this app :))) ;)
There is no reason provided for updates, so I provide no reason for more than 1 star.;
Can we make it so that rotating your phone would allow full screen for horizontal/landscape photos;
I was told by,7of my 9 daughters to give it a try!!.;
Boring. Twitter, a similar platform, is better.;
Best thing about this app is staying close with my friends and family;
Good 👍 5/4;
❤️;
Ladkiyan nahi hai bhai;
Horrible, twitter is superior;
No views on videos reels bakwas algorithm;
Damni;
Bekar;
U should get emoji's on the like button like on facebook it would help us alot;
This is literally the third time I've been on threads and they booted me out. I didn't even post or respond to anything. I tried signing back in but no confirmation number is being sent to my phone number. Anyone know how to delete my profile?;
Gud 👍;
Just pure copy cat;
Perfect app ♥️;
No way to create an account. The only option is to log in;
Nice application;
Excellent Performance threads;
We'll see where this app goes;
❣️💞💕;
Who wants to be censured like they do on FaceBook? Nope thanks!;
Bad;
Idiot app;
Its good 😃;
Nice app is the work;
Blue tick;
Good;
So I tried getting onto the app today and it wouldn't let me and instead made me have to do an appeal with verification to prove its me. I submitted it and they just put a message saying thanks and to wait until the appeal is finished being reviewed to see whether or not I can regain access to my account. Says if they find its not me that it will be permanently disabled which is bs! Hope they fix this and let me back on my account!;
Good App;
Mast hai ye app bahut pasand hai kya baat hai 😅👀;
I like threads;
great app but it would be better if on the following list, you'll see the accounts that doesn't follow you so it's easy to unfollow them and not having to check every accounts. also for Instagram!!! like pleaseeee;
Useless social media app. Fully similar look like 50% Twitter and 50% Instragram. And I have both of app. So why I use this app. Totally boring application. I can't spend my time on this app. So finally I uninstalled this boring app.😵‍💫👎🖕;
Ok;
Yes, now it is absolutely useless app, you should not download it at all, download it, your net will also be bad, this app is just like Samsung Instagram, you should not download it, more and more;
Waste.. no use.;
🙏❤;
Hio;
Garbage twitter clone. Would give 0 stars if possible;
Zedge is gay;
This app heg me...😠🤬;
Wrost then ever;
good app;
"Why anyone would give this more than one star given how bad it is? And I don't care if it's just ""starting out."" They had a chance to make this good at launch, KNOWING their competition at twitter, take the good parts from twitter and IMPROVE on it. But they didn't. Also considering this is owned by FB/Instagram, I'm not expecting this to get any better. Already bad enough I see posts from people THAT I DON'T FOLLOW, instead of the people I DO follow. So much for a ""twitter killer.""";
Better than Twitter;
Nice;
Very bad app;
Glitches all the way;
Very bad app. Instagram is good but Threads won't be like Twitter.;
Not able to open the app. I just installed the application and when I click on open its automatically closed. Please fix it, it's giving a very bad experience to the users.;
Not getting any reach And followers Worst app;
Not interested this app 👎 Twitter is best 👍;
Rajkumar;
Very bad app.;
Became boring after a while coz you can no more see the relevant posts.;

👌;
Why Threads doesn't allow us to sign up using our email address or phone number? We don't want to use Instagram account to log in. Hope to add this feature in the future. Thanks;
so far I haven't found myself using this app once;
Copy tea copy;
I don't have Instagram, so that's why I am unable to use Threads..;

Nice app;
What is USP of this app in Front of Tele??🙂;
Threads have more bugs than Instagram.. the list goes on n on.. hope it doesn't becomes another bloatware like ig...;
Good;
App smoothness is not good....opening photos are also not good as in instagram or twitter;
A twinned clone ? 🤷🏻;
Shady terms and conditions. Not falling for fine prints now.;
Excellent;
I don't use Instagram, I quit it but I wanna try threads and it's not allowing without insta account.;
Twitter is best Threads is west;
This is very nice app;
Horrible UI;

COPY OF AN ORIGINAL SELDOM WORKS!;
💟❣💟❣☺💖✍;
Try to come up with your own idea..it's a copycat of Twitter..plus forces you to Instagram account.and takes hell lot of permissions than it should. Influencers pls stay away from this app. Incase if you want to close ur account with threads. You'll have to close Instagram account too.;
Just average;
Don't download this is a trap;
What's the usecase of this app? Why would someone need 2 Instagrams?;
Boring;
Very good;
"Lmao y'all copied Twitter and said ""do better"" and i love it";
This platform is an undercooked turd. Literally everything you hate about Instagram is distilled down into something even more annoying. This is a content graveyard. It is where posts go to die. I even offered to give away $1000 if I could get to 50 followers in 3 days, and got ZERO engagement. Don't waste your time with this garbage. At least on Twitter, it feels like you're talking to somebody... Twitter is bad because of the people. Threads is bad because it's a bad platform.;
Very useful ... 👍;
Very excilent🤟;
Very bed;
just waste of time;
Very nice 🙂 i like Threads 😊👍;
Kyu banaya hai dada;
So easy to connect with contacts, brands, and influencers.;
Must have option to use on computer/laptop.;
No autoplay settings not as smooth as twitter and it's kinda dumb sometimes. It should have been somethin good for news. But it's apparently not.;
Nothing new;
A terrible app that nobody needed. Nothing works here as it should. The UI is cluttered, with ads all over the pages and the reels integration is a nightmare. Talking about Privacy in context to Meta is a lost cause so I won't dwell much on that.;
Nice app but i am having problem i can follow another account why is it like that;
This is very good app.;
Zuckerberg try something new, stop copying others, Tiktok = Instagram, Twitter = Threads;
It can still be better if more features are added. 3 stars for first experience.;
😂;
Copy;
Nice app;
I guess developers took advantage of FOMO and open source code of Twitter. This app is like an github clone project of Twitter. Feels polished but no engagement, no new stuff and only followed content is promoted. Learn from twitter and be better if you want a piece of this cake.;
😳😳😳😳🥺🥺🥺🥺;
Consume a lot of data;
I like the app;
Super 😊;
Yup;
Cancellation company;
इस एप को इंस्टॉल करने में मेरी Instagram I'd बंद हो गई है कृपया इस ऐप को इंस्टॉल ना करे ।👍;
"Very poor, working for 24 hrs then everything was ""something went wrong"" can see nothing but the main feed. You can only see what Threads wants you to see. Potential but right now bit of a train crash.";
Bogus app. No option there to disable auto play videos or managing the quality of photos. Very poorly copied app.;
It's the same.. what's the point;
Rubbish copy of Twitter. It completely useless. Uninstalling it;
Twitter was going to the dogs, so I left, this came along, I liked it's ease of use, it isn't a slanging match, I had no high expectations and it's exceeded them easily.;
I don't have Instagram account and I'm unable to login by other way. How can I login without Instagram account.;
Allow users to register on the app without necessarily having to operate Instagram. The current model is intrusive. It hard to anonymously use your app like one does on twitter. Delink registration from Instagram. That's the primary reason why I uninstalled the app without registering. You're making it very easy to trace people;

I don't like it;
Nothing special than Instagram, I don't think it's necessary to keep this app other than Instagram;
This is 🗑️🚮;
Well, i don't wanna use Twitter anymore !😋;
Very bad app;
Awesome;
It's just like twitter, why do I need to download twitter twice?????;
😶;
Nice aaps;
Threads Amazing Apps.;
Not so great an app. Basically same with twitter and you can't download videos or DM. That's why tiktok stand apart the flexibility and interaction is unmatched.;
Too bad;
Copy cats. What did you even do..?;
No need of this app;
❤️❤️;
Lovely;
When I open this app there are like glitch every time happens this;
Nothing much interesting;
Bakwas;
My choice;
Garbage;
No word to say. How to delete this app.;
Gy;
Very good;
Thread must have a updation.The app needs to be made a little more efficient. It's not satisfying. It would have been better if it had something like insta reels or something like a new game.;
Need #hashtags. Im looking for conversations about a particular topic. Cant do that on #Threads.;
4th of;
the whole app is a cheap imitation of twitter. Can't even post things properly.;
This app's fatal flaw is it's feed. Almost everytime I go on Threads, my feed is entirely made up of random people I do not follow and do not care about meaning I'll turn off the app almost immediately. This entire app would be saved by splitting the tabs into a following and a discovery one. Right now, it's not worth it.;
Like the purpose but unable to see any replies, likes, notifications etc. Just get a message saying 'something went wrong. Please try again'.;
খুব খারাপ;
Useless censoring copy cat;
He is tha best;
It's boring !!;
Give me blue mark;
It's regularly crashing down whenever you open it.;
Elon paid 1$ for this rating;
Waste;
Poor;
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎;
Bruh the new social app rip , same as twitter but with better UI but the biggest flex of twitter is open speech as u can give ur opinion on anything and their ceo is also cool , this app also collects lot of data and also there was nothing new just twitter users posting same content here also so it's a big fail.;
What a mess. A half assed app hosting a ton of half assed Libs all crying about Trump and MAGA. 🤣;
Fix the algortihm system so many unecessary things on my feed.;
Bad experience;
Maza nhi aya 🥱;
Good;
This app is so nice and sweet like Twitter;
Very poor service not usefull Twitter is very good better service and New update..;
Amazing app;
A cheap copy of twitter;
Minus point is that u can't delete your account 😭😭 if we did insta account bhi delete ho jye ga..... 😭 I hope yeah zero star ka bhi option hota;

Waste of time and data;
Copy will be never good as original;
Noob app;
A Twitter clone that is in internal closed alpha stage. The app sucks big time. Lacks on features and polish. Recommender algorithm straight up sucks. It almost feels like non existent. I guess it wasnt something meta invested in wholeheartedly. Also the biggest bummer is the Instagram mindset of the users. People can't be forced to morph into the forum like UX it provides. Absolutely no reason to switch from Twitter or Mastodon. Also no data transparency.;
Waste app it's copy of Twitter 😏🤦;
Bad and poor;
Good;
Worst app;
I like the concept, but it's not easy to use, feels like most of the functions never work. Currently I can't post threads or see my past threads on my profile. And my thread feed seems to just show a whole bunch of random users. I can't figure out how I can just see the people I follow. I don't see myself staying because it's wasting my time.;
I support Elon musk That's why i give 1 star... 😅;
Rr;
Cleaner content than Twitter, so far, but you can't search topics amongst public posts/threads? Yikes.;
Bekar hai bhaiya Mai toh toot gya...... Accha app hai par Twitter Twitter hai;
Very nice app thanks for creating;
Guigh;
Y it is asking for my insta account? Both r the different app.. should b login different.;

Add The Feature Of The Download Any Photo & Video;
Cyborg zuck copied twitter lol;
Quit copying other apps.;
Badly needs a way to filter out people you don't follow, as well as a page for trending topics. It's not really useful in its current state.;
👍;
Copycat naya;
Please broadcast my Videos properly that I can get more Followers.;
Copied;
Boring app;
Excellent;
Batter then tweeter 😀;
Honestly, this app is just a copy of Twitter and Tumblr. Twitter is far better than this app. I don't like this app, that's my personal opinion.;
Good;

Not good;
Copy of twtter 🤬🤬🤬🤬;
1 start 🧽 for writing review, Shame on you Zuck.... Elon musk Fan Here, Lol;
Very bad;
Absolute crash-fest on android, though not on my ipad. Hate the fact there is no search by hash tag function. My feed is nowhere near as relevant to my interests (which I have clearly indicated by my follows, likes etc) as it should be. I mean, it's also not good to be stuck in an echo chamber, but threads should know my taste very well by now, since a) I'm migrating from Insta b) both apps, particularly Threads, harvest an egregious amount of data from users;
Better than Twitter ✨☕🌚;
Thread is a mistake, unfortunately.;

App need some changes you may have difficulties when you use it, other thing is what's the point of using the app does it has any benefits?;
Twitter 🥱🔱;
This app vare nase;
Good start. Hot for a minute but hype has died. Please modernize app for foldables (Twitter is). I'd like to keep it open while doing other tasks. Also please add features to differentiate app from Twitter. Right now it's a lesser clone. Once the new app hype dies out, people will see it's not better than what already exists.;
Generally like it but there are almost constant issue with it loading & refreshing. Would like some additional features added as well. It's new, so I expect there to be bugs, but it's getting incredibly frustrating.;
This app died so quickly;
You can create account only if you have Instagram;
Like Instagram;
I can uninstall this application 😔 without log out insta id;
Censored twitter;
Just a copy of Twitter;
i dont need this app;
There's no messaging option 🙄;

Garbage 🗑 app. 🤮;
horrível;
Doesn't compare to Twitter it's relatively worse;
Stopped working for me. The only way to use it is through the app.;
I love this;
Nice;
Worthless so far. I have no idea what the feed is doing. It's not showing me any of the accounts that I follow, and the rare one I do see the post is 20 hours old. There's no way to sort by suggested, followed, most recent, personal lists, anything. There's no hashtags, no way to really search for the content I want to follow. Hurry up and get on adding more features to make this thing functional.;
add save photo option;
Why we copy, Why we need one more when one is perfect;
Zuck is cuck;
Bakwas hai;
Feed algorithm is worst.;
Tweeter is the best;
My favourite ❤️;
Wastage of time & space on the device. Life is simple. Dont complicate.;
Terrible ripoff of Twitter with way too much data collection to be legal;
Tiktoc ripoff by meta... Google plus was better than all of them.;
Cool Appp Goo Instagramm Group;

why does it delete my Instagram account if i want to delete threads;

Thrash app;
Elon Sucks;
It's fine besides not having a chronological timeline. If there's big breaking news you'll miss it.;
missing so many features;
I had to delete my account and delete the app and start over. After ONE DAY, 2 posts and 7 likes, IT IS FAILING TO POST AGAIN!!! No warning. Please fix this!!! I am on a Samsung tablet and for the past few days my posts and quoted posts fail to upload. I need help and sending a message to @zuck and @meta does not go through, because all my posts are failing. I deleted and reinstalled this app, to no avail. It seems I can repost only.;
Poooooooooorrrrrr;
Good;
More than any other app it has the potential to topple Twitter, but it needs features! We need a way to organize our follows.;
Nice environment;
Nice;
Nothing to explore 😂;
Threads by Meta is Better.;
Such a Ridiculous application;
It was great at the beginning. Now, text threads are failing to post. I reinstalled the app, cleared the cache, changed the internet connection, and still have the same problem. Very disappointing;
It's not Twitter;
Love it;
Needing an Instagram account to sign up is horrible, I won't use the app until I can make a unique Threads account.;
Aburridoooo;
Hi trends I'm just wondering why I can't use hastag on threads app;
warst;
*successfully copied twitter* With more personal data expose and more often ads coming soon...just like any other meta app. I still dont get why would they even require such sensitive info...not even gonna use anyway for personalized threads... it's just to sell it for ad companies and make money Traaashhh...;
Great potential but some fixes needed. I don't get notifications from some of the people I want to know when they have posted, I can't attach GIFS, I see a lot of accounts I don't follow and don't want to follow and have to spend so much time blocking and muting.;
Good;
There's no option to switch your feed to only people you follow, leaving users bombarded with verified accounts and painfully corporate garbage being thrown in the feed;
Won't let me sign up, just days login with Instagram;
Useless;
Horrible Twitter knock off;
Cheap copy of Twitter. Lizard boy copy everything from Facebook to Threads.;
Boring.....;
Bad application;
Best app;
Worst app;
Twitter >>>>>>>;
Excellent;
Professional account banana;
I am happy with the app so far. I wish that there were a few other features, like a favorites list or following tab so that I could switch back and forth. It is nice to be able to see people with similar interests and not be buried under bots and other hateful content. I am looking forward to future updates.;
So bad 😞;
I am enjoying using threads. I only wish I could tailor the post that appear on my homescreen to be more about what I like. Also, wish I could schedule or save posts I'm making for later. Also, I think it would be cool if you could try to make some widgets to be used on the homescreen of phones. Currently not having any luck of being noticed at all on the platform. Please make it easier somehow for smaller threads users to get noticed.;
Why would I need threads when I already have an instagram account which looks similar to the threads. Threads need some out of the box features which really makes us excited.;
No Trending like twitter , also I don't like Zuckerberg aa there will obviously be no free speech;
Rip off of Twitter with NO free speech. They will not let you think for yourself or speak for yourself;
Stupid and big privacy issues! You give away more info than other platforms and can't delete your account! Massive fail Zuck, you absolute p.o.s.;
This app use the usual restrictions and rules applied in FB and Instagram... But only for some people..;
Worst interface;
Poor copy of Twitter that works even worse.;
Worst app, don't have data saver option, consuming the data like motherfnk hell, why don't this fnk application have data saver option?;
Worth app;
I had high hopes for this app. Unfortunately there is way too many bugs that makes the user experience poor. Threads is also lacking on lots of features that Twitter currently has. The censorship and invasive data collection is also a big downside. The marketing made me believe threads would rival Twitter but I just don't see that happening. Threads needs a big revamping in order to actually compete with Twitter.;
Not good.. copy of twitter;
Enjoy the App;
Good;
This is just entertainment only not compare twitter;
Bugged out application.;
Good;
Won't let me login;
Its not twitter;
Also good 👍;
Nice app but this is a celebs and brends;
I have connected with some of my favorite people on the internet here.;
Bakwas;
I like apps;
Honestly, this app is so far a solidly good app, but I wish you guys could let me and the rest of us on here to change our profile without importing Instagram profile pictures.;
Nice;
Amazing 🤩;
Thank you;
Worst app don't use it Better use Twitter and won't allow a cheap copy of a great app exist in my application list;
Very bad;
Not too bad so far it feels a little barren in comparison to some other websites and apps but it has potential The quality control and filtering need some work And i'd like more control over the timeline of stuff I see but it's a start;
🤧🤧;
This is a pointless add on. Seriously just give it up that Twitter beat you at the thread game. People who use Instagram really do not care about threads af of they do they already use Twitter. The interface is also bland the vid posts look clunky with the text posts and the interface just makes the expernce a treasure hunt that you did not want to go on. Scroll across nope! Just down and down and oops missed a post up up up. Hey where did the feelng in my thumb go?;
Super 🤣😁😍👍;
Bad;

You need to be able to create a handle that is different from your Instagram profile. Other than that it's great;
Need improvement;
Super;
Can Be Better;
Copy cat zuck;
kia gathia aap yer akbi ladki request nahi dati 😏 koye download nahi karna;
We didn't like it as much as better told by Meta,;
I wants to know that if we delete Thread our Instagram account will also be deleted ?;
Timeline scrolling is not as good as twitter. It should be like going upwards. I quitted.;
Good;
Naic;
As soon as I opened this app it went smoothly but right after 3 days it started crashing & the app doesn't open even at all;
This is a great social media app And is Definitely the Twitter killer;
Love you too 💓😘 you;
So many bugs, really bad algorithm for home page;
Al principio bien, como todo, jajaja la tendencia puede con todo, pero la verdad llevo dos días intentando postear y no se ha podido, está fallando todo, que horror. Si es fácil de usar y es bonita, el blanco y negro se ve bien pero por qué ya dos días seguidos? Aparte pensé que era mi celular, obviamente lo reinicie, seguía sin servir, la desinstalé y no, sigue igual. Si les soy sincera, tenía más esperanzas de esta app.;
Massive privacy leech. Do not download. Just delete twitter and move on.;
Copy of twitter;
Bootleg Twitter;
Best of Instagram threads;

Very Nice App;

Super 💯;
Why Meta why? We already had Twitter. This is another redundant app. Facebook trynna literally copy each & everything from its competitors. Needless to say, the absurd logo looks like some kind of pubic hairs seen in WCs;
good;
My profile and activity pages don't work even after reinstalling the app again, not sure what's wrong. Is it possible to fix it?;
Nice;
Worst Social media application i have ever seen;
Nice👍;
😇😇😇😇😇🤟🤟🤟📱📱📱;
Waste;
Because it is from Instagram;
Does not work. Doesn't load profiles or anything. Gives me an error message. It's been like this for a week.;
Can't give it 5 stars, why is there no way to see who I am 'following'? Or who is 'following' me?;
No longer working. Can't post or read replies on other threads. I've reinstalled, updated, logged in and out, reported it. Still not working.;
Install;
Don't mess with Elon Musk 🥵;
Bekar he nothing to new;

Looks like you have to have an Instagram account, I don't have one and don't want one, so Threads is getting uninstall.;
Downloading it after Rosé created an acc and its confusing... but lets see;
Mm;
Copy of Twitter Shame on you zuck Thief Copy cat;
Average, I want to delete the account.;
So cool app ☺️;
Now This app is varry amazing;
New app nice 👍;

Not worth using, twitter is best;
Totally Useless;
Fake app;
You should add more features like othe apps And your app is nice for writing quotes 😊;
Nice;
Excellent...;
Same to Twitter;
The app is copied tweeter;
It's not new! Nothing is new in threads;
Hate it, hated twitter and tried to like this but hate it even more than twitter hahah;
Love it;
No nsfw allowed, so not a replacement for twitter and just another instagram;
Very nice;
Ooo;
Good 😊;
Bugs still not fixed and it has been a while now since launch. Pasting attempt, it highlights the first section when attempting to paste at end of message. New line half way through message creates a new thread in a thread. Large images still probably crash the phone. Cannot have feed for just followers. Hashtags don't do anything e.g. don't change colour, not searchable. Etc etc. Happy to update rating once fixed. S23Ultra 1Tb.;
Great copy of Twitter;
GIVE MORE SECURITY UPDATE TO MAIN CREATE ❤️ It provides more chance to become ultimate champion 😅;
Poor twitter clone, however if you like censorship and a lack of basic functionality this might be the app for you.;
Nice aap;
Copy cat;
Very interesting app, will be happy to see ufc fight live on this app;
Not interested 😐;
Cheap Twitter copy from AliExpress;
GCB high high fight;
This app is trash;
Useless and Boring 😴 🥱🥱;
Very bad user experience. Knock off version of X;
Open separate account opening option other than Instragram;
No trends.;
I can't find NSFW content on Threads. Going back to Twitter.;
Disgusting app;
Twitter is better, imo;
I like;
Very bad app nothing interesting lite version of twitter;
Khas nahi laga;
Bakwas app;
Nu recomand;
Not interested;
The only option I had was to sign in with an Instagram account, which I don't have. Sorry.;
Waste;
It looks like Twitter.;
Tite;
Good;
Good;
An unorganized mess;
Cause rosiee posieee in the threadsssssssss;
Runs well and is easier to use than twitter while not as much content as older social media (this is to be expected for a young app) it is easy to use and set up shows great promise;
App policy is terrible;
Not good at all, doesn't provides uh a dekstop or web version, crashes alot and made it so annoying that if uh join this then it's compulsory to have ur account activated otherwise if uh r gonna deactivate it, uh will end up loosing ur ig account too,as both of them would be deleted simultaneously. You'll end up regretting ur decision to create an account on this.;
Better than Instagram👏👏;
So far, so good. It's still in the early stages, and more features are being created as it's used, but so far, the experience has been great, and the community is supportive, positive, and helpful. There seems to be a concerted effort on the new users to block disinformation, hate speech, racism, and focus on sharing facts and real news.;
Elon;
"Its a good app. I have accidentally unhided the ""thread badge"" from Instagram bio. Please bring an option to add it back. :(";
Nice app;
Cloned Twitter;
Good;
Bhmk. K K K K K.v Fu Yu Hu Ju;
Works good in my phone, no issues whatsoever. Better than Instagram;
we need an EDIT option😭😭😭😭😭;

Worst user experience and boring user interface;
Worst app no one reply my thread;
Copy Cat of Twitter 😄;
Threads app needs a lot of work, but as a basic experience it actually functions well, much more than can be said of Twotter nowadays.;
Huh;
🥶🥶🥶;
Boring content... No trending, no DMs, just a useless app. And worst of you can't delete your account.;
Useless;
Twitter;
good but massager option is better;
fantastic;
Happy Journey;
Very good application for using this easy;
Early launched app Get crash all the time Can't delete account if once made Worst;
I downloaded the thread because I want to see rose' blackpink hahhaaha.... love🌹✨;
Well done 👍🙌🏻🎯👌;
App seems like it was clearly forced out to capitalize on Twitter controversy, but it has a lot of potential!;
It's look like duplicate of Twitter application, but I believe you have to work on image click bug. Whenever we are clicking on any image then instead of zooming like in Twitter image is getting little bit up and down (like vibration). So just amend some parameters in image click it will improve your application.;
Copy of Twitter;
Worst app;
Great app and easy to use just wished my home page just showed people I follow;
Very bad;
Waste of time to use 👎👎👎;
Cheap copy.;
Poor app 😕;
Not so good;
What the hell is that if you delete your thread acc your insta acc gets delete too? I did deleted my threads acc but my insta acc didn't got deleted but yeah I'm still scared , this is Hella bad insta;
No much better then Twitter 😄;
Works well. There are some cosmetic features I would like to see implemented, but give it time.;
bad work and bad support;
Great app! I always wanted to stop using Twitter and finally i found a better substitute.;
Twitter is much better than This 😡😡😡;
EXCELLENT!!!!!;
Nice app for Better results;
better than twit;
"""Sorry, something went wrong, try again"" messages are all over the app.";
There is no reason for it to be difficult to navigate and do basic things. Seems rushed and really needs more time in the developer oven. Seems like I'm flooded with secret advertisment everyone is selling something or trying to get you subscribed to them, it's quite hostile;
More want to development reels;
Similar, to...., but I enjoy it so far.;
Great App ! But hai to 😂 twitter ki Copy hi 👍 , Great Job Mark Bhaiya;
Can't post, can't see comments. Total bugfest.;
Nice AAP;
Worst;
Much interest;
Needs a lot of work;
This app is not working properly 😭😭;
It's an ok social site. Nothing special yet, but works as well as the others. I'll pop another star on this if they release a web version too.;
boooooooooooring;
Great app;

"Have been stuck on ""Sorry something went wrong"" for weeks now. Uninstalled/reinstalled, restarted phone, cleared cache, nothing works. Android Pixel 5. Please help!";
Dont like it;
Default feed shoes random irrelevant content despite following and mentioning likes.;
Excellent app for communication interface. Truly I'm addicted for this app. Instead of twitter I'll use this. Thank me META for providing such useful application.;
Mice app salman khan;
Why use this parody of Twitter and get banned for not being able to talk about freedom of speech. Ghey.;
Twitter 2.0 haha;
Very cool;
Boring;
Be aware this app is extremely invasive, pay attention to the permissions you're agreeing to with this one.;
Trash;
Why in the world is it linked with Instagram? Nobody wants all their Instagram followers to find them on a different app.;
I do not have instagram but i want threads. What to do?;
Please separate the following accounts from for you;
😖;
It's great except I can't watch videos with audio. If I click unmute the video stops playing. Finding support is impossible.;
samsung m 30 I can't post. I can't write comments. eternal loading. The post has been loading for over 2 weeks now. my posts are not showing up as activity;

Man*er app;
I can't see anyone I follow. The page is a ton of random posts with the people you follow mixed in. No way to actually see friends posts and see exclusively who you actually WANT to see.;
Totally waste of time and data ! Also super data thief! Totally useless;
ट्यूटर के बड़े पापा;
Just poor quality user experience;
I love it here;
Weak audience;

Please follow me Muntiyaz killer target😋1M;
App is stable and has most folks I follow at Twitter. It's missing few important features like desktop support, Search by keywords and trends. Hopefully those features are added soon;
Describe your thread personal problem 😞 Can't find girlfriend;
Pages are overlapping each other can't even see clearly home page;

Bro u really don't have to start this if u really want to just download Twitter. L app;
Please update chating option;

it's made by mark;
Nice;
Nice app;
🐦=🐐;
trash algorithm;
Nice app very fast growing this app;
Pure garbage. Lmao this was going to compete with Twitter (X)? 🤣;
Better than twiter;
I'm unable to post, comment, or like anything. It's been like this since day 2 of the apps launch. Submitted several help requests and nothing came of it. Decided to uninstall today. 👎🏻;
Threads soon gonna die 😂;
O just hate Meta and Zuckerberg;
Great app;
Better one;
Best 👍;

Good App;
So basically it's Twitter with Facebook censorship;
Good;
Good;
You really copied everything on Twitter. Why not create a separate newsfeed for 'following' and 'general population' then i wouldnt have to block unwanted accounts on my newsfeed.;
Total waste;
Very bad app;
Very awesome app;
Nice Platform 👍;
"This app is completely broken: I can't read or write posts on it due to a ""something went wrong"" error. What is wrong with Threads??";
I don't know why or how but it's lagging too much pls fix it;
Copied.;
Sukhuurang;
Very good;
Very much good 👍 Then compare to Twitter every one can use this without any limitations 🙏🏻 but having more features like background pic before DP on profile & thus making/showing the category such as artist, actor, visual art, so on. One thing having story option on both insta.or threads;
Likes and comments are not coming create on new account on Threads App.;
Nice;
Data looting;
I love it this app;
Update: Finally the issue have been resolved. It is running smoothly. Firstly from Day 1 the app is glitchy with overlapped posts and dragged screens. I haven't seen the actual interface till now. Secondly now it says that my instagram account will be deleted if I delete Threads. That's totally unfair. On one hand I can't use Threads and on the other hand I can't delete it. So I am left with last option of uninstalling it. I was so excited at first but now I am totally disappointed.;
Sorry Zuck, I don't fancy giving my info to you;
✨🔥 2023-07-24 🔰💫;
Super;
Has potential, but feed is full of accounts I don't follow or not interested in. Search function needs to include topics of interest.;
Supar aap;
A clearly well built app on a technical level, but god is it just so lame. Its like twitter (obv) except people only tweet Instagram captions with no picture. The lack of a trending tab, while making the app less doomery, also makes threads feel less interconnected and social.;
Without searchable hashtags its really not a viable alternative;
If good;
Behen kaa;

Very boring app;
Only gave this 5 stars bc Elon is fart;
Just another political app that creates hate and extremism.;
Doesn't load half of the screens! Sorry something went wrong all the f@#$ing time;
BESTTTT;
Bad;
Good app;
The best app ever;
Don bhai;
ONLY FOR YOU (ROSÉ) 🥰;
It's ok i guess;
they are collecting privacy information.. 😠😠;
I want to uninstall it but can't because of Instagram ☹️;
Worst app, this app is a threat to your privacy;
Clone is clone;
It is just a bug with an interface;
It's sad and lonely place.;
Not a good app;
Very nice 💯;
I love it 💖;
App is severly limited in functionality. 8 day's in and I can't follow anyone back. How am I supposed to grow my account?;
Needs a translate button;
Twitter is much better;
It good;
Not good;
Copied version of Twitter;
To much censoring. Twitter is much better;
My fave bird app is no more so I signed up here. Since I don't like the main feed filled with people/accounts I have no interest in and do not follow and since Instagram already has it, can you please have it so we can see our Following and Favorites easier? Please also have an option to Save the thread like Instagram posts. Thx.;
It needs a group chat feature to share tweets with friends. It also needs an explore/search feature to stay up to date with the latest news/trends/tweets. And finally, a feature to unlink my insta account to allow creation of anonymous accounts. Add these and it'll overtake twitter.;
Boring;
App is useless when I all I see is random posts from people and topics I don't know or care about. Why can't I just see people I Follow and in chronological order?;
Need web version and landscape mode for tablet;
Nice app;
Good;
its a good application;
Good 💯💯💯💯💯;
Another corpo app.;
It's like unseasoned Twitter;
It doesn't even deserve one star;
Good but could be better.;
the engagement feels fake and forced. those so called influencer only make it worse just try it for a while, get bored and coming back to the original app (you know what it is);
This is amazing. ❤ Very easy to uninstall;
I just tried it and this is my opinion. I would give it a zero if it was there cuz its just a worse copy of twitter. And what si that layout like I'm not a left handed. Meta just has taken twitter and made everything diffrent on their style and suddenly made it worse. Switch to twitter it is way simpler and better!;
Copy paste from twitter;
Not great, needs Instagram to use. No thanks;
It doesn't matter who you follow, everyone's posts go on your wall and you have to physically block the 100 million you don't want to see one at a time. They Zuckered it up real good. 1 billion ads.;
Bad;
the fall off is historic;
It's made by Facebook so it's bad already;
"It's just like a ""LIGHT TWITTER"" 💀💔";
Use the orginal , not copycats!!;
Algorithm timeline is like garbage;
👍;
Very friendly people on it.;
It's osm;
"Not Twitter, er, excuse me, ""X."" (Add as many laugh emojis as you see fit). So, no notes.";
Very good;
Needs more users;
Meh.. Better than twite rn.;
Don't know how I hot here. If i delete my entire Instagram will be deleted. It is a scam. Hate it the most.;
Clone of Twitter!;
Midia;
Bruh, can't even copy right.;
This app isn't gonna last if they don't make some major changes (like adding a following feed, literally the only way I would actually use the app regularly).;
Need to be able to search by hashtags for it to be functional. Otherwise, great alternative to Twitter;
bluds app felloff so hard;
All good, maybe an option for translating languages will be even better.;
Good;
It's Okay Nice !;
Very bad;
Fix the gallery selections;
The app does NOT work on androids. I reported a billion times and they have done NOTHING to solve thr issues. So I cannot use the app. So twitter it is;
This app is very good 😊😊😊 i;
It's got a lot of potential but for a week I haven't been able to follow anyone. If they think I'm a bot, they should make sure. It's just not fun anymore if I can't follow the people I want.;
It's a very good app I also post photo and video And make it viral So tq ❤️;
Not refreshing;
Worse experience ever;
Copy paste;
Very laggy app. Koo is far better than this also gives money;
Pathetic 🥺 Ctrl C & V 😂;
Just make it like Twitter. Is that hard?;
Good byy Elon and good byy Twitter 🤣🤣😂😂;
Worst app ever;
Pathetic clone;
I like it's mast app,,🤗🤗👌;
This is very amazing 😍;
Twitter best;
Woah!;
Very poor app, don't know the actual use;
क्या फायदा इसको चला कर जब कोई reply नही करता कोई gf भी नही बनी इससे मे डिलीट कर रहा हू।;
Terrível;
Worst app ever made;
Awesome;
Timeline(?) is full of posts from accounts I don't follow. Would have been great to see things from accounts I like;
(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*.✧;
First day ke din hi mera kisi ne account hack kar liya and mai kuch bhi nahi kar pa raha tha.;
Wow;
Good app but doesn't work properly what ever I do it comes up 'sorry can't load try again' or 'sorry we couldn't complete your request please try again in a moment' and how many times I try again it never works.;
Excellent 💞💞☀️;
Useless clone of Twitter;
I could not post, I could not comment, i could not thread...the app was basically useless for me even though I updated it. Please fix this;
Twitter rip-off;
Nice app;
It became insta with new UI, same vibe and info there;
Nice app;
What a trash ♻️ app!;
Worst app ever, gives the feeling of using Ctrl C + Ctrl V product Just like Mark stole FB earlier;
It tracks all of ur data;
Its too slow and crashing a lot;
It's not the other place, so that alone is worth 5 stars. However, I'm looking forward to future feature enhancements that will make the experience even better.;
Subscribe;
Worst app created. Twitter better;
Twitter is best;
Dumb app;
Ben this app;
A lot of potential, but it's still way too buggy. It's also way too sensitive on its auto-ban system. I'll follow 10 people, and then can't follow anyone else for at least 24 hours. Hoping Meta fixes all the issues soon so that I don't have to leave and come back later. Updating to say that they never respond in any way when you report an issue. 0 actual support.;
Best;
Seems like zuck wanted to make a Twitter ripoff with most numbers of guidelines and restrictions.;

MY POSTS KEEPS FAILING TO UPDATE! My posts and comments fails to post always... I can't post anything currently. Aside that, we need DIRECT MESSAGING Tab, and TRENDLIST .... Quite a nice one;
इस ऐप को थोपा जा रहा है, इसलिए मैं इस ऐप को 1 स्टार रेटिंग दूंगा, अगर आपको लगता कि वास्तव में इस ऐप को हमपर थोपने की कोशिश की जा रही है तो लाईक करें।;
Threads for better then Twitter for simple people.;
Its good but there is one problem, the search is only for profile not for the people that reply;
Wala lang miss ko na kasi sys;
Looks like a cheap copy of some other app;
Buggy. Also can't even change name without changing Instagram;
There is no hashtags it's just the same as Instagram;
Cool;
It is getting good;
"Over a week now and can't post anything. ""sorry, something went wrong""";
Better than Elon's app.;
Good app ..👍;
Very great app;
Copy cat;
It's just poorest of poorest public failure ever;
Keeps throwing me out everytime I try to open the app. Support isn't helpful;
cheap;
Worst app don't download .This is a cheating after removing thread account Instagram account also been deleted;
Just launched app.. surely has glitches.. but as soon i log in ..the entire interface goes haywire & overlaps each other making it a matrix of lines full of distortion.;
Worst experience. Not a single viewer or like comments... useless app;
twitter but without the fun, features, or real people.;
"I just noticed that sorting the ""earliest and latest"" following has been enabled but still doesn't make it easier to fish out who follows back or not. The following should be seen from the page instead of the user's profile to verify. Another thing is the app keeps glitching when you try to see who's following back and following back doesn't seem easy afterwards.";
Idk man seems and looks like an app from the 90's;
Super app;
Nithinlucky;
Twitter is going down, hopefully meta does a decent job at maintaining this app lmao, instagram got a really big homophobia problem and lacks moderation but this seems decent ngl;
Evert since I downloaded this app, my Facebook, PayPal, and Instagram keep getting hacked. I'm having to change passwords every day on each. Plus, when I tried to load pictures, it won't let me. Uninstalling;
I love थ्रेड @shanianimations;
, happy when am using this app;
Nice app, 2 in one, like Twitter as well as Instagram.;
Owsome. Brlient!;
Doesn't let you just see posts from people you follow in the order they were posted. This is like the most basic function in the world, but Threads can't do it.;
Instagram Dinesh Hhhj Nnm;
Good app;
Nice but followers nhi aata isaliye use nhi kr rhiii;
I have Instagram installed on my phone. The same username and password is not working in this app.;
I like it 🤍;
There's no real purpose to this app. It's stuck somewhere between instagram and twitter. Useless at the moment;
No information from the user.;
Useless try to be a copy. Nothing new. Cant delete or leave registering as connected with fb insta etc. Wasted time and money. Could make anything else useful for humanity;
Try something original;
Brilliant;
Garbage! App worked fine for a day, and then I woke up this morning and I can view people's posts but I can't view any replies, or leave a reply, or see my notifications. Sent support ticket but it's gone unanswered. This is total junk!;
Welcome change from the usual clutter on the bird app!;
Most Useless App Ever. Can't even pin a thread to one's profile. It needs work and update and until then, I won't recommend downloading it;
Elon ma;
Very waste app;
Flop app;

I don't delete my account;
I enjoy it but the search feature sucks. Why can't i look up topics? I can only look up people? How am i supposed to find new people and things if i cant search for stuff other than usernames?;
Very disappointed;
Whole User experience is worst;
'Sorry something went Wrong' I literally can't use it.;
When trying to post on Threads, I often get message that my post failed to post, even though it says that anyone can respond.;
Very nice application;
The best app and good by for the dead bird!;
seriously This app is sucks;
Worst app It's purely copy of Twitter and it's not worth it it's just a strategy of mark for taking down our personal information to sell it, yet from one more app(i.e threads);
Im sorry but the app is ah me;
Love;
Worst knock off of Twitter or X;
Osm;
Why can't I have a page to follow only those I follow without having to see other posts/threads I don't care about?;
Updated... 25--07-2023;
To much stuff on Ui;
Nice. Helpful;
Very good 👍🏻;
Why would is this app forcing us to keep our thread acc when i really don't wanna it's like violating our right to choose what we want;
Op app;
Honestly it's a great app except for the fact that if you delete ur threads account, your Instagram account goes with it. That needs to be fixed especially if you just wanna take a break from threads and deactivate for a while, whilst still having access to your Instagram account.;
It's a meta© product.;
Lumayan buat iseng2 lah. Bisa post video yg durasinya 5 menit lebih. Terus perbaiki tampilan & fiturnya Zuck biar makin keren.;
I don't like this app;
Racist app 🤢;
Lmfao so this is just a copy of twitter 🤣🤣🤣;
Doesnt go anywhere,, very little content,, just a bunch of talentless people asking you to follow them, lazy;
Awful. Immediately full of Influencers I'd never follow and awful political people. This was on day one! Uninstalled so I keep Instagram. Do better.;
Huge privacy concerns;
Itz a good aap but meta you have to give private chats also😐;
zuck sucks;
Bad app;
Boring app;
Needs a lot more tools but is still amazing.;
Basic at the moment but no issues and can't wait for the features in the pipeline;
Copy paste;
Very bad ap;
bad experience;
Very good 🙂;
Good enough Twitter clone;
I like it;
Tolong lah di home/timeline/beranda yg keluar itu akun yg kita ikuti, bukan acak gajelas begitu;
It's got a ways to go regarding features,but after trying several other similar apps it's got a strong start. I'm sure with enough time it will be even better.;
Add an option to turn on dark mode manually. It is useful when I want to use light mode in system but want to use dark mode in certain apps like threads;
This is better and very nice it's better than tweeter;
Wow 😲;
People never learn. Leave proprietary garbage behind. Install mastodon;
The only way this replaces (or even contends with) Twitter/X is if every single xcorp server simultaneously goes offline. There's NO control over the feed, with the entire thing feeling like a stripped down version of Facebook. I expect nothing and I'm still disappointed;
Just cool;
Wow 👌 Unique interface;
Bad;
Twitter is best than you lolll;
Sar please enable my Instagram reels option please 🙏🙏🙏🙏 1 month hogaya mara reels option nahi araha kya karunu;
Genuinely the worst social media app ever designed - following people is absolutely meaningless as there is no way to view only posts by people you follow. Whoever thought this was a good idea needs to be fired, and then hopefully never hired ever again.;
It's not useful;
Good aap;
Feed extremamente bagunçado e falta features basicas;
Best app for Twitter 🙂😁;
Good;
Haved little bugs and no have direct 😃😃;
Not good, unless you're really invested into instagram there's not much it offers. I made an account and was just immediately bombarded with constant political garbage and just countless threads mocking twitter. It just has no good original content and it doesn't promote creativity. The fact it boasts heavy moderation and censorship just makes it even more bland and boring and just leaves it one-sided echo chamber for politics and lame, sanitized jokes.;
U can call 🤙🤙🤙;
Musk has done a great job getting people to resent Twitter. Now it is up to Threads to keep them happy with the new app.;
good;
Nice;
I give thread only one star but it is not deserve any star this app is not give you any view. And nothing;
Its Twitter form alt account;
pretty good app!! it was so much more experience about it!!;
Rubbish keeps crashing, before log in;
كثير حلو;
So bored app;
I love Threads! It's so cool!;
It's missing features that should have been included on release, but it's actually trying to improve unlike it's competitor which is actively destroying itself;
I don't really get the point of this app. Meta needs to consolidate Facebook, Instagram, and Threads into just one platform. They have too many platforms, and I just wind up using very little of any of them.;
I just downloaded the update but I don't see the following tab;
I like it.;
Copyright;
Much better than Twitter 😁;
Eh. What's the point. Too many apps for me to have another. 🤷‍♂️;
എന്തിനോ വേണ്ടി തിളച്ചൊരു ആപ്പ് 🕊️;
I need à button to edit pic and videos and trending search area;
Great start, but it is missing some features that could make it better.;
App freezes when accessing a post via an external link. Need Alt Text. Otherwise good!;
Bad content;
horrible App I have ever seen in my entire life so many glitches I have found in this app and I don't like it's concept that necessarily you have to link your Instagram account with this threads app😠 I would say that Twitter is far better than threads Instagram;
Very bad;
Twitter Copy;
Suggestions photo saved option Add kijiye;
خر;
No features worth installing;
This is terrible, lots of content o don't care, the people seems like bots, nothing interesting, I cloud just pass years hiding content I don't like and it even will show more;
U guys should figure out how we can safely uninstall this App without erasing our instagram accounts first;
you gotta sign in with instagram. immediate 1 star;
Keep Holding search bar icon, open search pop-up like instagram.;
Better than twitter bird;
No Elon. 5 stars;
Please make it as a stand alone app. I don't have an Instagram account and I don't want to create one. But I want to use threads. I am giving only one star as if now, only to post this.;
Need a feed based on time posted. Wanna see nost recent;
I'm not a right wing nut; so it's great.
"Glad to see a ""following"" tab, as the inital feed upon launch was full of irrelevant posts from people I do not, nor would like to follow. Annoyingly the following tab option is hidden, you must press the threads logo as at the top of the page. And it is forgotten when closing the app. So you must remember to select the following tab each time you open the app.";
Not bad;
Nice app ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️;
Nice app appreciate thread team;
Great app 😁 thank you mark for making this app i always heated twitter;
Excellent compared to the dead Tweeter;
literally only verified accounts would show up on my feed;
Still lacks lots of features;
July 25 update says 2 ways to customize feed. Maybe on iOS but I just downloaded and it isn't yet available on Android!!!;
"Really enjoying this ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try again."" simulator! Super realistic. Nothing ever works, can't post text or images, 10/10";
Super;
Can not delete threads account? Why?;
Instagram but black cover;
Perfect;
X the everything app is the best in the entire face of planet.🐦✖️💪;
It works fine in my experience however there are random memes, videos and on my feed from accounts I don't follow and are not interested in. I mute these accounts however similar style posts from other accounts pop up instead. It would be nice if the amount of those kind of posts were reduced. Additionally the addition of a trending page would be good too.;
Dont use. This app is a privacy nightmare.;
I love you Instagram 🌹❥❥❥I miss you Instagram all time I like you I love you 🌹❥❥❥very much nice❥❥❥🌹;
Please enlarge or increase spacing btwn Like, Comment, Repost, and Share icons. And the Mute/Unmute button is aggravatingly small. Improve those two things & it's ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐;
It amazing 🤩;
Just works so smoothly, especially compared to Twitter.;
Useless;
Can't wait to see the app progress;
Getting better. Now we have image folders and can see avatars but I'm still reading posts of people I don't follow which sucks big time.;
Can you add an option to select dark mode like on Twitter/X;
I just dislike zuxx;
Ojalá no supere a Twitter, ya que si sucede eso, meta seguirá comportándose como un maldito monopolio, como siempre lo ah hecho con sus creadores;
Trash;
gae app lol;
Why do you need insta for this? Weird gatekeeping;
You can't start an account unless you have an Instagram account. I get scam messages for Instagram daily;
This app is very familiar to me and super easy to use. It's like Twitter without as many glitches and the other chaos now associated with that app. If you like Twitter, you'll love Threads. They are adding more features, so remember it is brand new (as of this review). One thing they need to update (and I'm hearing they will) is that the home Feeds tab doesn't necessarily show new posts from the accounts I follow. It's a combination of accounts I follow mixed with a bunch of random accounts.;
❤️❤️;
👍;
Its amazing. Not a single right wing nut job or Trump bot in sight. No hate. Just people getting along. For now..;
Copy;
"I CONTINUE TO NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE APP!! WAS ONLY ABLE TO USE IT FOR THE FIRST WEEK, AND SINCE THEN IT'S JUST ""SORRY, SOMETHING WENT WRONG""... REPORTED MULTIPLE TIMES, NO ANSWER! NOTIFICATIONS ARE BLANK, PROFILE THREADS ARE BLANK, CANNOT POST OR REPLY TO THREADS... FIX THIS!!! IT'S BEEN OVER 2 WEEKS!!";
Boring;
"I still can't customize my feed, and even if I could, ""people I follow"" should be a permanent setting. Without that, I won't be using Threads.";
Nice app;
Thats great app ..;
Bring back twitter;
Nice 💫;
Beats the hell out of sXitter already!;
Delete this app, it is useless.;
Need translations;
if it has dark mode it would be nice;
Nice App 👌🏻;
I would say add a trending page or something to see what's been popular topic on thread. It will feel more engaging overall. That's my only request so far.;
I have not been able to get a copy of threads, why not? Thank you Google. Joseph Johnson;
So fed up with not being able to follow for over a week and no end in sight. Thinking about abandoning the app. I do not recommend this app.;
Excellent 👍;
Honestly no reason to continue using it;
Its meh;
full of sucks;
Nice 😊 app 😃;
I download this app because of nct🤭😌 but i can't upload any photo, whyyyy. *problem has been solved. thank you*;
Okok.. but it really requires edit option...;
I like it;
I've downloaded the newest version but NONE of the updates promised in the What's New section are present.;
It's a copy paste of Twitter and Instagram Instagram face Twitter body it's totally copy paste I want to say zuku please make your own something. He is not a business he only copies no businessman can admire you;
Doesn't work well. And is boring and dread the features are to much like Twitter. The truth app is better than this app;
Cant post anything because it always says, something went wrong try again later. And its been weeks now.;
"All good now, just need search now...Installing and it errors with ""on boarding failed"" Oh no... Blue check marks ♾️";
Tolong diadain fitur buat DM biar bisa chatting;
very nice;
Good app;
Absolutely trash. Waste of time!;
AS;
The recent update lists: Two ways to customize your feed 💬 Translations 👀 New ways to filter notifications ➕ An easy Follow button ✅ “Approve all” follow requests It's a lie. Not one of those things exist in the app. It is nearly the same as before the update with one positive change: the feed now shows posts that don't include people you follow a well as those you do. Otherwise mine would rarely update.;
Good;
Good;
Just a bad copy of Twitter;
mr_mannu_garg;
Twitter is Best 😎;
There should be an option to switch accounts as well just like on Instagram. But overall, I'm getting used to it;
Good;
So nice future 😘😍🖤😍❤️;
Aight need more people tho;
It is not working to log in with any of my Instagram accounts;
Without hashtags, the app seems pointless. Same things are posted in Insta too. So why would i open this app?;
Nice and smooth;
Worest;
Useful than Tweeter 🤣🤣;
"Had to look up how to set my feed to ""Following"" - talk about unintuitive design.";
Bad Why do I have to delete my Instagram account if I want to delete my account in Threads;
Band kardo yarr Threads app #unused;
"Always have ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again."". On all screens. 🤦 The worst app.";
Glitch;
Twitter's copycat;
Excellent;
"ALMOST does its job. When trying to view my own profile as well as any other (aside from the feed or viewing posts from my feed), it gives a ""something went wrong""error. On iPadOS, it just says ""Content not available"", so it's device independent. Makes it impossible to use. Tried reinstalling and the issue persists";
Digital brosis wah kya app hai;
A good app I like & that's give me a hint of improving my content . This app is so expensive in free of cost I like it so much;
Quickly gets boring;
AP jo bhi launch kiya hai bahut achcha;
Nothing to say;
Profoundly boring.;
Best;
A quick way for large accounts to accept tonnes of follow request might be a good update. I'm so tired of scrolling down and approving requests that's been pending before I joined threads. It doesn't even scroll down to that point anymore. 😭;
Not working at all👎;
Simple, superficial and not entertaining.;
Good experience;
Don't support freedom of speech;
Collecting too much data;
it's kinda slow, still missing many features, need to save pictures and videos and such..;
Nice 🖤❤️;
You need region topics or trending topics to be specific to discussed. Not random people posted.;
copy;
Getting better every week.;
Much better than Elon Twitter (or X or whatever it is now). Have fun paying 8 dollars a month for that weird app that isn't even Twitter anymore.;
Copy and paste.;
Very Good app, an alternative of twitter.;
Pwe!;
Also we need to font sizes, colour and type in this application, To make a unique....;
With only being able to search other users with the search feature, then what's even the point?;
Gud application...By saintmsg;
Fake app;
I like this app but the other app like this is better. Maybe it's still in beta or whatever. When you start scrolling the timeline, the cursor is too sensitive and starts dragging things you don't want to drag. The application named 'threads', unfortunately there is no draft feature here, this will be difficult for me who wants to save threads to upload the next day.;
2023-07J-26th Seems you need an Instagram account to use? Not interested in one, so then can't use Threads.;
Boring 😒;
Awful!! I uninstall this app;
🤮🤮🤮;
It's a much more convenient for me than, for example, Twitter. But pay attention please, the view comments not working.;
it's really a great app, but I think it need a message feature;
I like threads;
Better option than X. The developers must introduce upgrades for better UI. An edit button is missing is one. Still great app for people to avoid hatred, bigotry, etc.;
Not loading even after update;
trash;
Twitter is better;
Was a great app to start. I've enjoyed being there far better than twitter. So much less toxic there and via Instagram can block troll/scam accounts + any other accounts they create which then reflects on threads as they're blocked there too. Downsides at the moment is that it is now very glitchy, threads often fail to post & options to see followers threads not available still, despite it NOW being available to everyone else!;
This is a nice app but 1 problem not a dark them option in app;
I have not been aple to start any thread for a long time. I can't see any replies. This makes the app completely useless for me. I hope this gets fixed soon.;
Loved the UI/UX;
So far, Threads is good. I'm waiting for more features like, Threads header and Archive button.;
We love Twitter 😊;
Cheap copy of X;
Very good app 👍;
"Getting there. The newer ""following"" feed is better than a feed full of tat, but it shouldn't be hidden behind an icon click. Needs alternative reactions (not just heart/like) but already feels much better than some well known equivalent apps ...";
Very good experience with this app ☺️☺️☺️;
You only see posts from brands and verified influencers. It's pretty pointless just now. Despite millions of users you see the same threads over and over;
Loving the platform. Been great making new contacts and engaging more with existing contacts.;
It shows me content that I'm not interested in!;
Raddi;
👍;
Twitter is better you damn cheap copy;
Hi ilon mask 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩kmon acen;
Bad ui;
The user interface is very bad;
it was cool at first, but it gets boring;
Fehd;
So much better than that X-crement app. Unless you're a troll Nazi, of course.;
It's a nice app..fun and interesting...had to change my review,the app has been showing posting for the past. 5days I've been unable to use it;
My experience since day 1 has been great. Developers are responsive.;
Basura, aburridisimo, no hay nada que hacer, es una porquería ver publicaciones de gente que ni sigues, el diseño es plano y no entretiene.;
Still too many bugs Crashes at least 3 times per day;
No dark mode. Give me dark mode and I'll make it a five star.;
Just copy paste from twitter;
Nice and stuff;
Excellent replacement for the ex-social media platform that's abandoned all pretense of protecting users from disinformation. Easy to use. Good design. 👍;
Great app;
Fantastic! Haha Elon! You suck!!;
Brilliant, continues to improve every day, carousel feature is great. Easier on the eye.;
Adding a star because it's improving! ----- So far, it's kind of a mess because you can't view only those you follow. Twitter still has that, so far ... I may not stick with this app if they don't let me curate my own feed.;
Useless app;
search option is only for username. Bad.;
Don't let MAGA fool you, Threads is G-R-E-A-T !!! 👍;
It needs a way to save a thread And it needs a veryyyyy creative music system that you can add music to a attached videos and like instagram amd you can save music from a thread;
Totally usesless app .copycat;
The experience is really just about average, but the fact that you don't just follow your friends makes it a little unique.;
Wasting of time, an copy of others!;
Enjoying this alternative to Twitter. Look forward to its continued growth;
Not bad I think it's good need to work on scrolling sensitivity..and I'm always with new ideas and creativity ♡;
Worst app and copy material;
please update my VIP official;
Is not good, look like Instagram;
Amazing;
Much better now! Glad to see that user requests are being listened to.;
Jai baba ki;
2 weeks of crashes. No crashes when browsing, but constant crashes when trying to add or edit content, etc. Can't add more than one pic at a time or it will crash, etc.;
I dropped Twitter after finding a calm and informative environment on Threads. No trolls or haters, no creeps in my DM. It's a friendly space.;
Mark is the biggest scam. Tweet is the real deal. Elon is the best;
Im a fan of Elon Musk, now you know why I rated 1 💪😏;
Please also add not just accounts from instagram, but also from facebook. I deleted my insta😭 I need to tweet but twitter has lot of nonsensical rules and gonna be gone soon so this is my only hope haha;
So many bugs;
Love it. I have been looking for a replacement for Twitter for a while, and now I'm sure I finally found one! Still has a few features to add and some minor bugs, which is to be expected from a new app, but it does exactly what it's supposed to do. Don't ever feel the need to go back on Twitter now!;
copyright fringedment maybe;
"The app is in the early stages, but I can see where in time this forum can become useful and fun. I'm already finding most of the people/celebs/groups/companies that I already enjoyed following on other social apps, so while it is a bit quieter I feel when the app moves to a web version and gains ""threading"" threads that people will stay better engaged.";
This app is way better than the original app. Way comforting as well;
👎;
😂;
"Desperately needs hashtags or discover features. Can't find any threads that aren't from people you follow or on the ""for you"", and the fyp is trash with no direction.";
It's not Twitter so I'm happy;
Lesser version of twitter;
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌😢👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌;
Osm apk;
Dumpster fire;
Lol it is like twitter;
This thing starts bugging when I'm scroll down the app bro 💀 Edit : the app is already fix now thanks 👍;
Good;
I just uninstalled and redownload. Still not seeing the following tab;
It is a good application, but if they put a group section like Facebook it would be very interesting so we could discuss the topics that interest the groups;
Amazing ☺️🤩;
Why do I see threads from random people in my feed...;
Worst app;
No dark mode;
Bad 😞;
Good functionality at initial release. The dev team has already made many positive changes in the first 2 weeks. Looking forward to more great features coming soon!;
The app's just a Twitter (now X) replica.;
Still missing some features like bookmarks, and media tab on your profile. I also prefer the search page on Instagram which shows you some posts from people you might be interested in following. But other than that it's a nice change of pace from twitter;
Boring;
Good;
This app is depressing from the very first day i opened this app about two weeks ago i was welcomed with a restriction pop up from that day till date the restriction warnings keeps poping up each time i try to follow back a follower its so frustrating.;
They claim latest update would allow you to weed out all the other annoying profiles of people you don't know or follow and only show those you do just like Instagram and Twitter BUT THAT'S A LIE!! Still seeing DOZENS of profiles from all kinds of profiles and they're HOURS OLD POSTS!!! 🤬;
ls this app easy To use ❤️;
Feed customization isn't working. I'm still getting my followers and recommended accounts in one feed instead of separated. The UI is fine, works smoothly, but why isn't my feed customized right after I just updated it?;
Nice app, but needs more editing. Please add an inbox where we can share messages without using Instagram.;
For you feed must not be the top option. I have not seen a single person who cared about suggested content. There must be an option to see content you actually follow and another option to set it to be opened by default. All of the suggestions are irrelevant mess.;
Bad;
Please include dark mode feature on threads;
I don't literally get it what this is all about, and for what or why this is needed. 🤷‍♂️ And is that a bug issue or what, why can't I show my badge number in my instag profile as an icon instead of Link 🔗.;
Instagram account delete kar do par Twitter se best to nhi hai yaar yeh;
A good start. Looks beautiful. Just need to get hashtags and a explore page now. The trickiest part, but would make the biggest difference for the app.;
Awesome;
Not Twitter;
Free;
Cool;
Now I used it 10 days. I feel good but i think there is need to a lot of work.chating option is makeing good it.;
That's amazing experience;
Day;
Nice;
Threads app is a lite version of Twitter 😏;
Good;
Perfect!;
Vip app;
Horrible lacks everything and content is extremely boring, and you can't delete your threads account without deleting your Instagram one.;
I got some glitches like screen is overlapping, profile is not open;
If you hate free speech and love oppression of ideas, join threads!!!!;
Waste;
Twitter knockoff that doesnt even accomplish anything. Forgot it existed after like 2 days;
Amazing app with an unmatched scope!;
Unless you want to follow big brands, this app is pointless. There's no good way to connect with people with similar interests.;
It has trouble loading comments and even profiles. Had to reinstall but still getting same issues;
Maybe I'm blind but I don't see any translation options with the update?;
At first I was following in love with this app, but last two weeks I cannot see my previous posts and post new ones.;
For Sony Xperia 5 II it always appears a message that says: Sorry, something went wrong. Try again later. I can't see my and the other ones profiles.;
just a copy paste of twitter;
Fabulous app. So many wonderful features. A lot of fun!!;
Elon gang;
We also need Direct messages here;
Awful app never works;
Woowwe;
Horrible;
Usefull this app public Thanks for Instagram 💕;
Well you can't just copy someone elses work. (Read that again) Twitter never worked for me, I don't see Threads working either. It was good at the start giving me the old Facebook statuses vibe or a place where we can just casually thread but now with all the celebs/corporations threading I am going to have to delete this app. I don't want to wake up to thousands of threads from famous people and companies as I don't have the time scrolling through it. Maybe they need another tab for celebs?!?!;
Simply waste;
Good app? Very current....;
Threads, an Instagram good app.;
🙂🙂;
Worst;
it's okay, not worth the hype. like it's giving twitter, it's very similar to twitter, you know? it gets boring and there's nothing special about it. it was overhyped during the app launch and it was never that serious. there's no point of this apps existence, i'm not saying it's a bad app because it's a copy and paste of twitter even though it is, but it's a bad app because it's not needed. like what're we suppose to do with this? honestly i have no idea so let's unlaunch this app real quick.;
This app is so boring it's ridiculous. I hate that it automatically follows all these verified accounts instead of letting us choose who we start following. Yes we can unfollow but the list is so very long now! This is the most intrusive app ever, do not recommend. You can't delete your profile btw, ever.. Without deleting your insta.;
I used this once. Then I changed my password. Now I'm not able to log back in;
Hahaha obly 3.1? Elon wins ig;
Better than twitter Awsome;
Awesome 👍;
Good app hai ji 👍👍👍;
Bahut badhiya Bhai;
Topap;
Garbage. Everywhere says something went wrong. Can't check notification, following, accounts.;
Just love this app❤️;
"The ""for you"" vs ""following"" feeds don't show up on Android even after update";
Honestly completely forget about the app;
Worst app I ever installed;
"I can't post, I just get ""your thread failed to upload"" error, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4. Please fix urgently, I'm a social media manager and this is prevents us publishing since there is no we interface.";
We already have Twitter!;
Good app;
Best app;
I hope I can download pictures and there's a night mode on. My eyes are hurting esp when I'm scrolling at night.;
💯🔥🔥💥;
I wish I could give 0, suckerburg.;
Kio bana ye;
Has much less features compared to Twitter and they are keeping the users as hostages because if you delete the thread account your Instagram account will also get deleted. 😅;
New and beautiful experience;
It has potential but lacks features like trending and search by topic function all you can do is search for accounts there's no discover page.;
Still need to grow and improved;
every time I open the app I see posts I don't care to see;
Pls assist I suddenly can't login to threads . It keeps telling me password was changed by the owner and its my thread and linked to my Instagram. Pls what can I do. Thank you;
Very sleek and very boring.;
Es threads an Instagram se ladkiyan reply kregi yaa nahi 😖;
Kalamsk;
Boring app, exact replica of twitter which really shouldn't be allowed, and missing way more features than twitter, which makes twitter the better option to use still than this app.;
Twitter is better;
"Threads need a ""save post"" option like the original Instagram app.";
Is that app still not doing any harm? I downloaded that one myself, so people say that if you delete that one, Instagram will be deleted, those lies.;
Zukerberg app , Hell No.....;
Elonnn gang;
Very very bad;
Mc jokar insta I'd follow me 25k follow;
Twitter is better. There is no outside updates like news,events etc...Only just to see tweets of the people.Be real man.It is worst to use. Twitter is better;
This a worse clone of Twitter, don't install and don't use;
"Hey! Hope u guys are going well without any stress, you're honestly doing great! So, for me, it's just actually an almost perfect experience bc I really miss the 'header' option 💔 I'm SO insanely SAD :'( I can't be without it it's SO special for me bc I can express a lot of everything there with a header 💔 In other things I genuinely think is great and I don't care abt nothing ""more"" bc there's liberating without the pressure of world affairs but just the accts to see abt it when u're healthy.";
Trending page. Now!;
It's so boring app. We can't do nothing more in this app.;
Good;
Useless app, however 5 stars cuz screw musk;
Since Elon Musk has rebranded Twitter into X, now you should rename Threads into Twitter. That's it. Pay me later for this idea.;
Because what the actual trash is this? I didn't even get a chance to use it and it keeps crashing.;
Useless app;
Twitter better;
maangas;
I cant seem to chat on this app...;
Boring, overall just celebrities all over your feed posting nothing good. App is unstable and very limited. Impossible to make friends on there, you basically need to have had a large Instagram following to import otherwise you just talk to yourself.;
It just became junk.. Just like Twitter, after this last damn update.. unsolicited content now appearing in threads. Started off with just the subscribed feed/related content. Now have to block each damn one. Thought this was gonna be different.. So what next? ads.???Might as well to back to Twitter.;
"A ""lite"" version is a must! This is too bloated for something that looks like Instagram lite.";
Could it be anymore terrible;
Full of bugs, not worth trying to get in touch with meta support;
Super bad app that kept showing post from random people and not what your friend post.;
I wanted to give this zero but the one least rating here.;
Nice... Btw I wish android user can use this🥺;
I keep seeing other people's posts i never follow.;
Not that I use it much anyway, but it basically doesn't work. It seems I can make a post, and I can view the main feed - but search, my page and the likes tab all just give an error message ('something went wrong. Try again...'). It was fine for the first 2-3 days, and given that ever since. Not really useable when the majority of tabs don't even work.;
Nice App'S;
1. When someone threads (?) Post with pic we can't download them that's really disappointing 2. If you have created ur thread acc and if you delete it your insta will also be deleted like wtfff;
Sensational App, I hope it stays this way;
Don't even no were to sign up;
1k complete jaldi hoga umid hai 👉 follow;
After a few days it becomes boring;
Useless app app created to get all of out data to steal our privay even they get browsing data and gallery i recomend do not download this app;
Bad;
"add ""Pin post"" 🤷🏻‍♀️🙏🙏";
When this app is launched Within the 2 hours I have downloaded it, It's amazing and one of most beautiful thing which I likes more is that it can link with Instagram both are good aaps Thanks Mark Zuckerberg 😊;
Gud application and but application name is hard..;
App Zucks;
It's not bad but I don't have a lot of futures and it is just some pics and text that we can share and it makes it boring;
The community is good but lacking many features. There are no trending topics, there's no free text or tag search, no official API yet, and no Web access to Threads either. It has potential in terms of size of userbase and the fact that Meta is behind it, but this is not a finished social network.;
Trash;
Accepting request is difficult task;
Bad Random posts by random people. Lots of garbage inspirational quotes and selfies of random narcissistic vacuous people Why the heck would anyone want to see any of that? It's like Instagram but somehow it's even worse;
🙌💖;
Stupid app;
Bad;
New update;
😔😔😔;
So good and beautiful app for everyone 💕;
Nice app 👍;
very disappointing app.....👎👎👎;
Better than elmos 1984 jack of all trades x app, you can translate and view following tab now, much better and can only get better, whereas the alternative will get worse.;
SUCH A THIRD CLass App ..very Disappointed..don't Download It 😔;
Uggly;
Such a waste of an app, time, energy and space in my phone;
Threads an Instagram;
Good enough..better than Twitter !;
Useless;
Good apps;
Good;
I want double tap to like. As Instagram;
Very good app Mark Zuckerberg thanks 🙏;
Pleasantly surprised, great experience so far, nice clean design, seems like a really positive community too. Pleased to see they are working on adding some of the much-needed features such as a following tab, also really need some way of seeing trending topics.;
Polah;
Hello chitter;
Pretty good but it needs some more work;
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️;
This just copy paste of twitter;
This is just another version of Instagram mmm it needs a lot of work coz it's just dum.;
just for attention and business and data steal...pis of sh# joker apps with zuck...off nga;
Awesome;
Bad;
A best app;
"I CAN'T POST MY THREADS ANYMORE IT'S WRITTEN ""post failed"" 😭😭😭";
Nice app;
Only a piece of garbage;
Useless;
This is a bad copy of X (former name Twitter) and this app is very limited and separated you from online world and it's look like local and limited.;
Worked beautifully during the initial rollout, now it no longer works even after the update. Just has a blank screen with constant spooling of logo. Waste of time as I can't uninstall and reinstall as it will delete my Instagram account, too. Very disappointed.;
We hope that these apps will not let us down 🙏😌😌;
Opn;
copy cat zuker;
I can't rate it at all because I'm unable to upload posts to my threads these past few days... Over 15 replies and posts are unable to upload to my threads... Please you need to resolve this as I am having a hard time;
Improvement is needed I feel the feed loading is comparatively slower and UI lacks simplicity when compared to X( twitter);
Happyness life🫣;
Just a twitter copy but doesn't have ads i guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Needs a lot of polishing tho and still ain't enoguh people to have fun;
Good appreciate;
Amazing appp;
Amazing platform 👏👏👏;
hard to use can't swap tab with just slide the finger to the left or right.;
Vaibhav;
Copy of twitter;
good but not best;
Good morning my help with that one;
Khara 🤌;
Meta and its affiliates are known to harvest user data and sell them to other companies. As long as the app isn't approved in the EU (strong privacy policy) don't download it or use your Instagram to create an account.;
This app is great. But we need together conversation.;
SamsungGalaxyTabA6 SM-T580;
eh;
Great start!;
There's quite bugs and lagging but it's understandable because it's a work in progress. I will still give it 5 stars because this app looks promising. I just wanna suggest too that since other apps have banners or cover photo. Can we have themes like in messenger? But only in profile tab. The app just looks a bit bland to me, hoping for more design/customization.;
Sort of works. I constantly get an error saying something went wrong. I have cleared data, cleared cache, reinstalled and still the same thing. Can't view replies or notifications.;
Excellent thanks;
Not interesting and;
Not Bad 🫣 Need txt option 😎;
Nice very very nice;
Nice apps;
Very nice;
Best app;
Garbage attempt to copy Twitter;
Increase your followers;
You fool why did you put my thread link on my insta profile automatically 😡😡 Don't you understand the term privacy 🤨;
Downloaded This App , Just For The Trend. Twitter is Way Better;
Very nice application;
What's the difference b/w that grocery shop vs threads ...he he chokerberg;
Puneetsuper_starrrr recover account fast;
Automatically deleted my account on Instagram & thread app 🤬🤬🤬🤬;
can't use it if i don't have Instagram account;
bull sheet;
Great app but need some improvements;
Great;
Boring;
Good interface Nice design Looks like twitter. Cross of insta and twitter But lacks some features of twitter like Translations under threads, don't have trending page like twitter, Don't have short videos like in twitter, Don't have view button like on twitter which shows how many saw your tweets.;
🤍🤍;
I love it. And it's clean not like twitter where all the hashtags directly linked to ] P**n. Threads is linked to your instagram. It gives you sudden boost of followers and you can communicate with them easily.;
Please make this app great we need it;
Worse than X / Twitter. I never see posts from people I follow and the ui is sub par;
Bad app, Twitter is way better;
Ok while it lasted;
It's bad cause I need to delete the account but there's no option to do this;
Another annoying scammers app Instagram was and is just fine than to add or follow more people in threads. Stick with Instagram not worth the hassle if annoying scammers;
Worst app.really disgusting;
It's a beta guys stop complaining If it's crashes not gonna lie your device is old and trash;
❤️❤️❤️❤️;
Trash = Threads;
😇👍⚡;
Nice;
Cringe 🤬😡🤬;
Just another cheap copy of Twitter.;
Not sure why I need an Instagram account to use this account. Like if you want to link accounts sure, but I should be able to just join from the get-go.;
Not so useful;
Precious 💞;

prefiro o twitter e outra coisa, agora fica aquele negocio horrivel no meu perfil do instagram, cancela;
It needs a lot of work to be done about it.This the second time I have been logged out by thread and told to verify my account and wasting my time;
No app goal;
Doesn't let you open an account without having an Instagram account. Bs.;
مدري شوضعه حذفته وابي ارجعه القاه مو راضي بتحمل 🤨;
If we install this we can't delete this if you want you need to delete Instagram;
New Boring Twitter;
NEVER GET THIS APP! IT IS SO STUPID YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET TWITTER!!! WHATEVER DO, DO NOT LINK YOUR INSTAGRAM!;
Not working just keeps loading;
Make a linux Version, please;
My account got issues;
What a ridiculous app! It's literally a copycat of Twitter now X. If you like being censored then sure stay on Meta but I will stick with X as it is far better then anything Meta has to offer.;
Awesome app;
stop showing the threads of users i dont follow;
Waste;
Worst app ever;
The new for you/following tabs keep disappearing and I NEED a desktop version please.;
Bhut hi aacha hai;
Better than Twitter;
Kuch samajh nhi aya;
Copy Paste;
Boring;
The worst app in existence;
I love this app ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤;
Copy paste from Twitter nothing new in this app and the apperance is sucks;
I Don't trust on this app. Previous apps records to sale data , I don't trust it;
Booooooring......;
Fail.;
It's just another face of Insta;
So good;
Good 👍🏻;
Not working properly 😐;
Won't even let me register. Just let it die.;
Superb;
So nice;
Nice apps;
That's great but not earning option in this;
I registered and now I can't delete my account unless I delete my Instagram account too. So I uninstalled the app.;
Useless. Keeps refreshing itself while im writing a reply comment. Looks crp too. Update, this app keeps freezing. Is this really supposed to be an alternative to Twitter? Lol;
Not ready to compete twitter;
Boring;
Boring;
Best app;
Well, the concept is copy-paste and has no customization/personalization options for the feed and content.;
Great app;
Don't have Instagram, can't open Threads account.;
"For a new social media app, it's pretty good, with only a few issues that come to mind as someone who is a casual user of social media. At the time of writing this, there is no ""Following"" tab to see posts from people you follow, but I've heard that feature is coming out very soon. Another slightly inconvenient thing is that you can't see any of the posts you've liked, or if there is a way to see them, it's not clear at all, I would like to be able to go back and see what posts I've liked.";
Very good app to download the best app;
Copycat aap;
Zuck is a cuck;
copy;
Copies as X, worst copied application we've experienced yet;
No freedom of expression;
The app was working for first few days. Then notification stopped working, showing some error message. Also not able post new threads/texts. Tried re-installing but no luck.;
Well pleased good job with the service;
Suru me sabko achha lagta hai 💀;
Good;
nice app just add more theme pls♥️;
Threads, Like ➕❤❤❤❤;
Very bad;
They tried to copy twitter;
it don't doing well, i don't like the policy and privacy that meta are doing.;
Terrible. I installed the app while I was on holidays in Europe. I am originally from Australia. Now it seems I'm banned because the app is not available in Europe. How terrible.;
Elon musk vs Mark jakarburg;
It stopped uploading since yesterday....and slow in response;
Can't see comments or respond to a post via a comment, constantly says something is wrong.;
Nice 👍🙂🙂🙂;
Just a fail;
"Smooth interface, a bit barren though. But with every mistake twitt-I mean ""X"" makes, more will flock to Threads. It has a chance of being the premier social media app.";
Very good!;
Twitter is better;
Kira kira rame gak?;
I can't install;
Good ☺️;
cannot post;
Not okay with my having to make Instagram accounts just to have different threads profiles. That's right. I prefer threads were its own thing (THANK YOU VERY MUCH) bourgeoisie 🙄 I like to have different accounts for my different interests nice and separate, and I don't want to make a billion insta accounts. But I guess this is what happens when one money hungry rich idiot sells Twitter to another rich idiot who doesn't know a thing about running a company and destroys it➡️ Elon the muskrat 😡;
Really Good App;
Twitter clone restricted;
link previews work again, thx!;
Haha, Rip threads 💀;
It's basically Twitter but with censorship and fewer features. I don't recommend it.;
كل ماتعمل حاجه تلاقي عملك بلوك حرفيا مقر.ف;
Very bad experience because in it no #(hastag);
Love it! Two things that I would want in the app are direct messaging and multiple accounts!!;
Nice app;
What the defence b/w insta and this;
All Instagram needs to do is to change its name to Twitter Lol;
There is no logical reason for this to exist 🚫;
Can't install without instsgram;
After a few weeks of using it. Threads felt like a wasteland. There's nothing to engage other than feed section where I don't have capabilities to choose what I want to see in the feed.;
This aap was the most popular and the best aap ever made for the most popular and easy;
Useless app;
Tattiiii app;
It would be cool if there was a more local profiles page, where there would be posts describing you that do not go into the news feed, but remain on your local page, and when viewing the profile they could be seen;
Very nice;
Awesome app. I love it 💓😍 🥰.;
Copyright 🤮🤢;
Where is the translation function? Also, it doesn't have the 'save' button function for pictures in the post;
where is the translation button? 🤷;

This app keeps stopping in background everytime I connect to internet;
Chu**a;
Boring app;
Meh;
Not much useful compared to twitter. It shows accounts I am not even following.;
Very bad👎👎👎👎👎;
Don't install this app because this app ban my insta I'd;
Yah bahut accha app hai mujhe bahut Achcha Laga 😊😊💯💯;
⭐ Twitter: A Frustrating Experience! 😡🚫 1/5 ⛔️ From constant algorithm changes that clutter my feed with irrelevant content to an overwhelming influx of spam and trolls, using Twitter has become a cumbersome task. 2/5 ⛔️ The character limit stifles meaningful discussions, and the lack of proper moderation allows toxicity to thrive, making the platform an unfriendly space for many users.;
Twetter copy 🚫;
Very Very important app;
Was excited at first but after some time I realised its never going to live up to expectations. It's just Instagram but with tweets instead of captions. It doesn't have trending topics and ofcourse, since it's Instagram, it doesn't allow discussion of certain topics or sharing of certain photos or videos. It will never be or come close to Twitter. Do not waste your time.;
Copied;
Time pass h Factory of distraction 🤯🤯;
Let us save pictures;
Large companies likes meta, Google trying to occupy the field by launching their own app just for their own benefit by suppressing small apps;
at this point this app is useless for two reasons: 1. the feed is mixed (it's full of people and accounts I don't know). i suggest they add two columns: following and for you. 2. no hashtags no usable search function.;
Deactivated my account.Its completely pointless.;
There is no messaging features and Not able to save another post.;
Without hashtags its pointless. People want an alternative to twitter.;
App is nice. But the app doesn't have dark mode option. So add the dark mode off for all device.;
I love this app;
It is good but after the update a lot of things are broken again so changing the review to 3 stars 😮‍💨;
"It's a great app just like Twitter (now X). Mark's motto is ""Why work hard when you can just copy and paste 😁""";
Ok;
Underwhelming. Doesn't support account deletion without deleting IG;
Bad... Ctrl + C + P;
We need Dark mode here. ⚫🖤;
You can do better than this;
کصشعر;
Well by using this app, my Instagram account got hacked.;
🔥;
Regurgitated pile of excrement, don't waste your time;
X ( twitter ) is better...;
It took me under a minute to realise this was evil.;
Don't copy;
Barely works, always getting a lot of errors. The app shows some ref dots for new updates, but the page to see them har need failing for weeks.;
Best app;
Becareful, your data is important!!!;
If you really wanna beat X you need to give what X don't like able to write very long words.;
It's good;
Exlent ❤️;
I see it as an alternative to Instagram and Facebook. Twitter users are different. Instagram and Facebook will suffer for reason only this garbage kind of thread app;
This app is useless , you didn't create anything new here , you just copied ( stole ) twitter and gave it another name 👎;
I just love this app I give a 100%;
A lot of work need to be done, not my job to tell you where to start.;
This app does not support keyword search. As an active Twitter user, the lack of this feature is a showstopper, and the app is next to useless for me. Having the feature currently in the pipeline is understandable, but the fact that Meta decided to hype a beta version just to gain momentum over Twitter is disappointing. Uninstalling this app.;
Absolutely pointless, irrelevant, and dead.;
Fantastic application for expressing our feelings;
Thread is a good app but I don't like the issue of not accepting large amount of followers request at once it's totally tiring to start accepting each of my followers I have 4k followers;
I'm unable to view profiles, my own and others. Also, I can't see comments on threads, just the original post itself. On the whole the people on the platform are extremely positive and uplifting, unlike other platforms.;
It's so much cool;
Facebook bans people for expressing their opinion;
Great 👍;
Twitter is better I mean X;
مسخره بازیای زاکربرگ. بهرگزد پای توییتر (x)نمیرسه;
It's as close to original Twitter as anyone has come. I'm happy to join and wait for the additions that will totally replace and best even heyday Twitter.;
bugs, crashes, lots of QoL it needs some work.;
It's like Twitter but worse somehow.;
Pretty good extension;
"Threads is boring. What initially seemed like a perfect solution for all things Twitter, became more of what Instagram already is: 'Captions labelled as threads.' I don't entirely blame the devs here though; people are just not willing to do anything different here. Unless the team brings in some life altering, news centric changes: like trending news stories and popular hashtags, this will likely not hit the spot. Quitting for now, but still on the fence to see what is to come next.";
Ok, so now we need the option to be able to search for content, to able to use hashtags etc. cause all I'm able to do is search for users.;
Racist app;
Good;
Can say boo on there. Get warning 3 your out. Newspapers couldn't even post a story and got posts taken down and warned one more time you're out. Plus, they want way too much access to everything on your phone everything. It's an echo chamber . It's sucks unless you like not having free speech. Just remember, he admitted to hiding the truth on covid 19 plus a lot of other stuff . He is a government controlled.;
Good;
This app is bad and it is the worst app in the world's bad apps. यह ऐप घटिया है ही और दुनिया की घटिया ऐप्स में सबसे घटिया ऐप है।;
Nothing really innovative. Just Meta lamely trying to copy X/Twitter.;
Like that this way;
👿👌🔐;
So beautiful & good;
Bye bye threads... You can scroll through this app for 20 minutes and not see ONE account you follow. Just ads and disorienting, algorithmic trash thrown at you. Duces.;
Cheap Copy of Twitter;
Great style!;
Bad app;
Import from Instagram doesn't work for profile or bio;
Overall the app is solid. Nice, lean foundation. Needs some added features to it to better the use. Otherwise keep it up.;
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤;
It lag(like a broken screen) when i want to type , so I can't pretty much see anything. And if you could how do i know i seeing what i follow/friend post?;
Was great in theory but poor execution. The first day I saw my followers/people I followed. Then it was ALL people I didn't and I never saw anyone I followed unless u went to their profile. Definitely needs fixing. And a separate website. And easier access to be able to switch accounts like Instagram.;
Love it;
Wow amazing new App;
Sasta twitter;
Nice;
I don't think restrictions are good for this app I understand you want to protect your community but if we don't connect with others due to restrictions how are we going to grow.;
Its worthless insta is better;
Nice;
Bad, is not like twitter;
Not better than Twitter;

It is a nice app, but can we have option to see between post of people we actually followed and the recommendation? Sometimes the recommendation is just annoying;
Not interested;
Unless you are giving me an option to use this in my mobile or desktop browser. I am never using threads. And it's dying for good.;
Good;
Nace Appy Good;

PILTANDAS;
Very good and good;
This is literally an Instagram redesign. And it looks awful;
Data security is very bad...... It's leaked all your data information to third party. So be careful. Don't install this application.;
Very bad experience...😔;
I can't post anything or edit anything at all. I haven't been able to since launch. I'm active US military living overseas and I'm not sure if it's because of my European sim card or VPN or what. I've tried cellular data, wifi, VPN off, VPN on, different VPN locations, clearing cache, clearing data, restarting, reinstalling, everything. I use a Samsung Note 20 Ultra 5G with a Vodafone sim card. I've also tried it on different phones with the same result. Basically unusable.;
Amazing 😊;
i hate mark suckerberg!! 😔🤬🤬😡😭🦅🤑😿🤬🗿;
Nice app❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️;
"Please Enable The ""Dark Mode"" Option.";
I used it for a couple days. Error started poping up. I cannot use my feed, post anything or interact with anyone.;
Very nice app;
Please add an option to prevent autoplay of videos. (And maybe auto download of images also.) I'm on a mobile data plan that I have to pay by megabytes and that drains my bandwidth.;
Very good 👍;
Bekar hai faltu app hai;
Trash;
Nice;
I downloaded this app in the hopes of replacing X, former Twitter, since I think it might be imploding thanks to Musk. There aren't enough profiles on board. Some that I follow on Twitter are not (yet) on threads. I really don't like that it doesn't have some sort of equal to trending topics or topics to follow.;
Totally awful. It gives me both restrictions. I can't follow or like anyone posts. It’s been 2 week now. After all it didn’t told me that how many days are left. I need update 'bout this or am not gonna use it anymore. 😕;
Umfal;
Don't want this copy of twitter made by meta. Using twitter and deleting this app. Why to start again when we are already going good on Twitter.;
It's very good Application for interact for other;
Copied idea from Twitter....create some genuine app;
Copy;
Worst app. Not a good app to use.;
Rubbish. Apart from the publicised issues with following and such, app simply won't work: full feed is present, but not replies, mentions and ability to even post all don't work, rendering the app entirely useless.;
Yas;
Not bad.;
Aap acha to hai per agar ey Instagram se hai To esame reels ka option nahi Ey to hona hi chahiye tha;
عادي مافيش جديد;
Copied from Twitter;
Inside the app I'm not having any issues. Except one. And it was this morning that it was pointed out that there was a new translator button only I don't have that button. There was an update 3 days ago which I did do but apparently this update did not take because I have none of the new features that they say they've released. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't fix the problem. Contacted the developer and am waiting. If this isn't fixed I will not be using the app.;
Very nice 👍👍👍👍👍 iiiiiiiiiiiii;
Love the app as a replacement to Twitter.;
so bad;
nice app ✌️🖤;
Great;
App literally doesn't work.;
Lo instalé pq habían puesto límite de mensajes en twitter y me fui ahí. El for you page no funciona de manera adecuada y l mitad de cosas las censuran, en algún momento pensé porque la página se estaba adecuando pero fue totalmente lo contrario. Es solo una copia de twitter con contenido más limitado no la recomiendo. Su estética puede llegar a ser bonita pero nada que ver con la página.;
Wonderful idea but lots of bug's app asking again and again you password wrong;
Nice app;
Bogus;
The app is nice. The only thing it lack is the trending page and obviously translation features I follow alot of creator that doesnt speak English and the translation features would really help (Edit. 29 July of 2023) The new update add translation features, At least that's what it says on the playstore. But there isn't any translation feature once the app is open. I'm guessing it is a bug?;
Brilliant app! My new go to for social media;
This is an Amazing app! I like how it performs, it's buttery-smooth and so fast, I wish they add couple of features to the future updates such as a following page, being able to edit Threads and DMs would be great. But overall it's a great social media app and I'm enjoying it so far.;
It sucks;
Never works;
Very good;
Best app ever;
Amazing 🤩;
I can't believe how good it is;
I am do it;

After two weeks, I can no longer follow other accounts. I can still post. I've been in this jail over a week with no response from META or threadsapp. No indication as to what I did wrong. VERY DISSAPOINTING. I was hoping it would replace Twitter...;
Twitter is better than this app👍👍;
The app is absolutely ridiculous...;
Amezing application;
My first install was broken & missed UI so I had a profile with no interaction. Reinstallation of threads fixed the UI issue & saved my login. 4/5 I have no friends so cool app. Buggy so I could find exploits.;
The follow/for you tab sometimes disappear and pulling all the way up just refreshing the tab you're on. Swiping to change tab is a bit inconsistent as well. Glad the mute function actually works! Help get rid of uninterested content fast;
This app lasted less than an average men in bed.;
Not 🚫 good;
Nice App;
Hi is copi tuwitae;
Copycat;
Fantastic and helpful;
I'd install it if we could make an account without having instagram;
SJW woke posts only. I was censored for saying the Virus was man made in China.;

"Threads app shows promise as a daily diary platform with its Twitter-like interface. However, it would benefit from a ""Filter by Date, Month, and Year"" option to enhance the user experience.";
This is a waste app;
Worst app ever, even a simple RTL text not rendered correctly;
Even though I have an extra 60 gb free on my phone this app is still a waste of memory. Nothing useful or interesting, stay away from this app;
Hoping it kills off the blue bird, but it's still buggy af.;
Prefect app;
This app is rubbish and will never be a worthwhile backup for established apps like instgram or even Facebook so just don't bother with it;
Currently pretty mid won't lie but once those are introduced I will be a great successor to what twitter once was and will likely never be again thanks to nelo skum;
Bad;
Kinda boring;
It is literally a knock off of Twitter Sued how you like that;
What is this ??? I want to meet hoodlum. I think he's my baby father.;
Twitter better I give this app 1/10;
Great app;
The worst app I've ever used . If I delete Threads it deleted my Instagram account. Tbh it doesn't even deserve the one star i gave . Hate this app a lot .;
Ver bad app. No new ideas. A lot of bugs;
App for all;
It a ok app;
A+++;
Amazing App;
Cheap knockoff;
Data Privacy;
It's a good start but we need better ways to search topics & find feeds we want.;
Fun simple app, easy to find all the people and brands I enjoy following, nothing overly complicated.;
🤔🤔🤗 Nice app ❤️;
No way to create an account within the app;
Loving it, excited for its growth.;
Easy to connect and see, even posting a reply, haven't posted anything, soon. Thank you Threads family.;

Can't see notifications or my profile content or any profile content or comments it's always says: sorry something went wrong. try again These updates are a disaster;
I can't read replies of someone id please fix this problem Then I will change my mind;
Promising, but needs improvements;
👍;
Congratulations;
🔥🔥🔥🔥;
Best quality;
Blocked by no reason And army of bugs there;
Well well well;
For god's sake let us filter the timeline to only people we follow. I follow people because I care about what they post and I can't even see any of it without going to their profile. It's like scrolling through adware for popular accounts to find my friends.;
Best;
zayyar;
This is a worst app I have ever seen my life. Don't know how to solve we restricted certain activity to protect our community. I reported several time to solve this problem, but still it occurs.;
Waste of time;
😘😘😘😘;
@god#father#vido#Don#Trap#AK#47#music#Trend#Nawab#Sandhu#;

The app's fine, although we need a better search result option. I need to see threads instead of people's profiles, and a translate option perharps?;
The app in the world i love it 😍;
Needs way more features to compete with Twitter;
Worst app ever;
Nice-😊👌👍;
Not great;
Instagram account me 1m followers;
Cheap copy of X;
disappointing;
Good;
Shitlongated Muskrat getting into Twitter was a mistake.;
Way too many permissions required to use this, also X is better.;
It's just a begging...;
At first it was operating smoothly but after a week, I couldn't see my notifications nor those who followed my account. I logged out,then I signed in again. It persisted. I uninstalled it and downloaded again,still the same issue. Then I tried to clear the cookies and cache and it still glitches...;
Pathetic app, Totally a copy of Twitter X, Bad app, Elon Musk Jindabad.;
This apk can't replace Twitter;
Cery nice;
I was keen to give this app a go but I don't have Instagram, so I can't even make an account.;
Sucks;
you guys need to really update the translation option here!! do it asap !;
The worse and fake Twitter. Don't put it in the Play Store if the users can't even post or normally use it! All my posts crash, even those I posted days before. Go away, fake Twitter.;
Very nice platform but video uploading very slow please solve this issue;
Worst;
Wrost app I ever seen;
"The uploading button is keep rolling. Please provide us with ""cancel upload"" button.";
Dangggg... nice nice;

I'm not to sure about this app I don't really use it too mch;
Twitter 🤡;
🤜🤛;
Nice but need some upgrade;
X is so far better !;
It's the best app I have ever seen;
Doesn't work for me. I want to look for eg news topics which I can do on twitter but the search only gives me people with that word in their profile name. Maybe there is a way to do it but I havent stumbled across a profile that discusses the topic.;
Faltu aap....;
Pretty bare-bones. But at least the guy running the joint isn't knocking up the help.;
Very bad app;
boring;
Seriously i have to screenshot pict to save it?;
This app is trash 🗑 Its only waste of time and your energy . Moreover, I never felt any new thing in this app it's just a copy of Instagram and twitter.So a complete No from my side Yakkhh 🤮;
Farzi 😂;
Nice;
All i see is blue tick peoples threads.no reach for normal people;
OK alternative to Twitter;
no discovery section or trending hashtag section... boring. this app is just Instagram with less pictures;
Best aap;
😊😊;
Nice;
Bad;
I like this app;
Disgusting amounts of data collected, INCLUDING PICTURES OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT!! This app takes photos and recordings without your knowledge. It's not even approved for use in EU yet due to their predatory data collection. This is disgusting, screw this app.;
Everybody post pictures here;
Give us option to download images on Android and put the like button on the right side;
I hope there's a pinned thread too.;
Love it so much;
No privacy. Just want people to spend their valuable time on social media;
👑;
Not bad;
Not useful;
Super;
Over power;
pls add dark mode;
Its not good;
Terrible;
This app needs a trending page! As soon as it does, goodbye rivals;
I'm just gonna stick with Twitter for now as this app collects so much privacy data which I'm just not comfortable with that.;
Thank you..at least we wont miss twitter because we have something better now .;
It's not working. In the beginning, I was enjoying this app, but suddenly, it stopped working properly. Now I can't post nor see my previous threads. Can't search or see my friends' posts. The only function left is the feed. Reported these errors, but nothing has changed. So exhausting;
Nice futures;
Silly;
It's not equal for Twitter.. Also;
App is just a ripoff of twitter and nothing poor app;
We would've been thrilled to have the option of translating on threads☺️;
We don't need it;
They tried to copy twitter, but failed at even that. Quite pathetic to say the least;
Copy;
TWITTER is BETTER than this junk.;
Endless stitching;
Esta app tiene futuro, mientras sigan trabajando en ella;
It's still not good, it just contains random famous people;
Install this for Baekhyun;
Not available for Windows, which is where I spend most of my time.;
Almost as bad as tik tok on the private data collection, guess they're getting ready for the next 'election' 😂;
Best than Twitter;
Thik thak;
Was supposed to be an alternative in response to the downfall of Twitter, now they're both terrible apps...;
Jiski marji ho woh thread app ko delete kar sakta hai 😂 sab bolte hai ki thread delete Kiya toh instgram bhi delete ho jayega , Aisa kuch nahi hai mene bhi delete kar liya hai kuch ghanta bhi nahi delete hua hai. Sach batao toh mujhe ye app bohot ghatiya laga. Is liye mene is app ko delete kar diya 😂;
Totally useless App. Copycat Twitter! 👎;
Cant see post others,cant post anything..;
This good platform;
Just another Garbage;
Absolute Trash! 🗑️ Even failed to copy twitter;

Can you please add the option to share Spotify lyrics?;
Worse;
Good;
Cheap copy of twitter;
Good 👍 application;
It's like Twitter (or whatever the hell it's calling itself these days) but with significantly less Nazis. I hope it keeps growing. If you have an Instagram account already, you're basically already signed up.;
Not good enough you need to work more;
Delete it;
Very very good;
Follow me on Threads and Please Save The Birds;
It's getting there - but I REALLY need to install it on my laptop as that's where I spend most of my time!;
Too many bugs and no features;
Great;
It's a dump app;
Goood;
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩;
No hashtags, no GIFs, no option to embed videos from other users, no pinned posts. There's still a lot of ways to improve this app, I hope it happens quickly enough;
Great concept. Notifications not refreshing. Updated : no help from support. Not refreshing, not posting, nothing. I'll give it another week before I delete it.;
Not recommended!;
It would be nice to be able to switch accounts!;
Restriction is too much on the app. You cannot follow, cannot like everytime we restristrict certain activity to protect our community. This totally disgusting.;
Still cant filter by following. Im updated, uninstalled, reinstalled, everything but when i tap the Threads icon i dont get the option and am stuck on For You. Last ditch before im back to X -- help me out here Zuckernerd;
You have to have an instagram account? I don't want to do a whole other thing I just want to make one account for the thing I want. Is it possible to make a Threads account?;
나는 방금 백현 때문에 어플을 다운받았습니다;
Can't use hashtags and after write tags and post thems tags didn't use and that colors didn't change to blue;
Best alternative of Twitter... Soon it'll rise than X (Ex Twitter);
Un useful;
The app logged me out and won't let me log back in;
will not let me sign in on computer;
Love the community.;
I am enjoying the service well enough but it's missing a very important feature. There is no way to search for a specific topic you're interested in. It's hard to find conversations to join if you can only see what's going on in your timeline. Joining live conversations via social media is one of the most popular features of a service of this kind.;
Stupid copy if instagram lol, nothing interesting!;
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!;
Nice app;
Came out of the gate running. Looking forward to what this becomes.;
Was starting to hate twitter thankgod now we have thread.;
Collects too much personal info;
Very Bad;
Boring, like a skimmed version of Twitter.;
Too many account po-up in my feed that not suit for me;
Waste;
When I deleted the app my Instagram account is gone;
"Way worse of a setup than ""X""";
It wasn't that good;
Not able to compete with Twitter sorry Mera guys;
Garbage;
Bad app;
I like Threads, but I'd like to see both more options for searching for topics, as well as a webpage/desktop version.;

I don't see this app lasting more than 2 years. There's no way you're going to be able to compete with Twitter;

"Pretty boring to be honest,I think people only download this app to get the “account number."" it's an interesting feature but not worth the hype.The app seems to be full of boomers. although it is directly connected to Instagram and Facebook and has a load ton of my data, the fyp is still trash . Although I like that there is no ad, I think it's the only useful feature and just a copy paste of twitter. In short it's not better than Twitter and is not worth the hype.";
Nic;
Gh;
Threads is a lot better now, but we still are very much in need of some way to create topics on Threads via hashtags or some equivalent. If I want to look up posts concerning a topic, I can't really do that right now without finding a person's account first.;
Awesome!;
Need photo Download option;
Very nice;
Not good;
Not as good as X... And not enough interesting people to follow.;
Nice Instagram 💯;

It's bad. Imagine I can't use Threads without an Instagram account Twitter is better than this!;
Trash;
Bad;
बकवास है threads मत करो instead;
Boring app;
Very good 😊👍;
Nice app Thanks to threads developer's We are proud of meta products;
A great app that doesn't restrict the user's freedom and doesn't charge the user to know, much better than Twitter or X;
💯💯💯😍🙏😍;
Jaldi vaha se hato 😂😂😂;
Here's some feedback.......could I double tap to like posts and have the entire rethread, comment, and share/send on the right of the posts.....it's alil janky to move all the way to the left of the screen with your thumb to like a post. liking posts and having the comment option easier to reach will make scrolling threads alil bit more fun imo.;
"Loved it but after a couple of days I get a message of ""Something went wrong. Try again"" on my profile and notifications tab so I cant see or do anything anymore since. My internet is perfect, tried clearing cache and reinstalling, etc but nothing works. Probably a glitch. Its also missing important features but they can add them on the way.";
Read the privacy policy. It collects your phone calls and records them, text messages, political statuses, emails and logs them, collects your videos, pictures, your location, hone addresses and CREDIT SCORE... STAY AWAY;
Totally garbage;
This app lacks features. It's just an abyss;
Do not copy any app;
Discussing;
I can see the posts and that's it. Error for: my own threads, opening threads, liking or seeing the likes, etc. You had a perfectly good design to beat X, and you ruined it.;
Copy paste 🌚;
It's the same as Instagram, showing me the vulgar, cringe content that I never subscribed to. At this point, Meta has no idea what they're doing. They can just copy others and the whole Meta ecosystem is shallow and absolutely contributes to triggering my mental health with all the bottom of the gutter goo that they shove up my face. Hope Meta goes bankrupt and the world moves on to better things.;
Intersted;
Work it;
nice app;
ugh... the app means that was similarly Twitter's X but... 😵😵😵;

Useless copy of twitter;
Trying to access and today it says I've been logged out and doesn't offer me any options to log back in. If I click on the error message it just closes it all out;
Useful app;
Didn't liked it;
Search and hashtag has to be incorporated. Also splitting up feeds of followers and a general landing page would be great.;
Thirtclass;
Missing basic features at launch;
No option for #hastags and trending . it is same like Instagram only .;
Bad app;
Almost perfect.. but lacking all the thing i like. 1. Preview image soo low quality. 2. can't zoom the image always reset. 3. can't post nsfw content:(. 4. the app no privacy at all. 5. Don't want to app tracking my location, phone data, etc.;
Twitter on a really bad day be like... 🙃;
A lot censured;

Better than elon musk app, go for it mark zuckerburg!!;

Collecting personal data like credit score, purchase history and religious or political beliefs is not necessary for an app.;
So many bugs. This is supposed to be Twitter/X's rival? Elon Musk doing the worst thing to that Bird App is better than this.;
My experience is poor. I cannot post or see anything I previously posted or reactions to me. It has been a few weeks now. I never give this kind of rating but the experience has been a lack thereof.;

Yuck!;
The algorithm is very inaccurate and too random as an artist I don't find dis app useful to grow a community since the algorithm is not to specified people's likings it's recommending my illustration to wrong audiences. I hope u can change dis algorithm cause is too out of hand, I gave it one week uploaded two illustration daily basis and barely got any likes. I even tried scrolling down to see recommendation and when I did there were no consistency on the same theme recommendations were random.;

You need to give Instagram your information 1st, not a individual app.;

they just disabled my account without warning thats why my ig main account is still disabled. Its been 3weeks and still no action? Pls fix it. I regretted i made an account in threads.;

Okay just logged into threads after like a week away. New tab called following appears. My heart quickens, clicks, screams in joy as I see what I have been waiting for. Okay good bye twitter/ X.;
I was a Twitter follower and since the ownership change it changed (for the worst). Threads came along and we love it. I would love to see and use it on my computer. Using a keyboard and a larger screen would be nice.;

What i hate about this app that my wall is always fielded by posts by the people that i dont follow. And meta doesn't seem to care to use algorhythm to do that;

The thread app is a valuable tool for concurrent programming, enabling efficient multitasking within a single process. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage threads, enhancing performance on multi-core processors. However, users must exercise caution in handling synchronization to prevent race conditions and deadlocks. Proper understanding of multi-threading concepts is essential for maximizing the app's potential. Overall, the thread app offers great utility for developers, but care a;

Ripoff Twitter;
Not gud;

Threads app, billed as a rival to Twitter, falls flat on multiple levels. It pales in comparison to the features and user experience offered by its competitor. The app fails to deliver engaging content, lacks a thriving community, and feels like a cheap imitation. Stick with Twitter for a truly fulfilling social media experience.;
So boring app ever;
I was extatic to use it, but recently got an error on my profile page which doesn't go away even if Threads are reinstalled. Reported the problem, but nothing happened since. Sad to delete the app;

If you're gonna be a copycat twitter, copy the good parts of it. No hashtags, one page where 95% of the accounts are ones I don't follow & have no interest in following (doing a lot of muting & blocking), and like Instagram I can't keep a photo zoomed in. Everytime I open it I'm just annoyed at how much work I have to put into it to find the content I enjoy;

I don't see a point of this app, it's basically a dumbed down version of Instagram. The only thing I like about Twitter is how I can follow trends and hashtags, none of which exists in this app in any extent.;

Great alternative to Twitter oh wait it's called X now use this over X it also carrys over your followers from Instagram if they have a threads account and it just merges your Instagram account to your threads wich is nice kinda mid but they are improving it 5 stars;

The data Threads collects YOU, on its users, is insane. Go to Data Safety section and see for yourself. Sinister.;

One of my good experience with thread is that it's so comfortable and reliable 😍🤟;
This app is only over hyped as per my experience nothing unique or attractive in it. 😐😐 It's just a scam to me as for now we also cannot delete this app as doing so will also delete your Instagram account. So think before you install it.;
Not really good if any changes and new features come then it will be..ok;
It's a good app thanks 😊 ☺;
Why companies with heavy budgets, can't come up with new ideas? They want every bone by themselves only. Drop it!;

This is a nice Twitter replacement in terms of features and creators, but there is something wrong with scrolling. On my Samsung Note 20, scrolling is very stiff with very little coast. It makes it quite hard to scroll the content, and physically uncomfortable.;

Needs heavy improvement. The algorithm is beyond catastrophic. I see posts from people that I don't even follow instead of those that I do. No hasthags, no post searching, legit nothing. This app was rushed and it's suffering now.;
Thank u threads nagkabati kami dahil sau😚😚;
Just awful. I see in my feed anything but those i follow.;

I don't see the point. This app is just like Instagram or Twitter, but with worse overall user experience. Zuckerberg just came out with this app as a middle finger to Musk. Nothing more. I can't imagine they invested much money into it, knowing that it would fail.;

Very Bad decision by makers because of sign in with the Instagram details there is no difference between Instagram and threads people posting their post same like Instagram whenever there is no hope of arrival of politics and all sensitive people with their confidential input only because of two problems First one is linking with Instagram Second one is interface Sorry to say but Very hard to defeat twitter;

"The biggest problem with this app: I'm not following anything and yet I was forced to see ""popular"" accounts in my Home/Timeline? Do you even think it's a good idea? All the suggested posts in Metaverse apps are also the same and it's annoying. I know it's for ""reach"" but you're not supposed to call them ""social media"" anymore, but it's advertising media. Never gonna use 'em.";
Boring;
We post large no of post but only 8 followers are gain in start time of threads and the other hand other people have gain thousand and millions of followers are gain why? Just blody app;

It only shows me two posts from who I follow, then nothing but suggested posts. There's no way to see a feed of who you follow. There's also no desktop version available.;
Its got good potential but so far, it's missing some important features (explore page);
maybe the one thing I can say is this is the best.;

I do Regret installing this app now I can't delete my account because My Instagram account will be deleted too 😭;
Just a Twitter clone but with less features. Stop trying to clone others' success;
Reached my account;

I'm uninstalling this application because of the word limit. The application doesn't allow me to write more than 500 letters in a single Post. That is so irritating for me...;
It's very good;
I'm trying to use it but I don't know how to use it;

There is no reason I need this. In fact I think life would be less beautiful with this app.;
Wow. Technologically and functionally it is clear that it is behind Twitter. The part that really shocked me was the level of pure hatred and single mindedness of focus... immediately it was like anti Trump f'bombs... and I kept scrolling looking for normal discussion on other topics.. but it just keeps going and going. At the end of the day this is just a political app it appears. Sad use of Facebook technology honestly. AND it Ned's moderation. Twitter is bad. This is more bad. :(;
I thought I was gonna get hooked. But... Just not as much fun as I thought it would be. Almost felt like google hangout back in the day (if anyone remembers that).;
Don't work without Instagram account!!! 😡;

So laggy on my device;
Alright I feel like threads is a good place.;
Useless;
I don't want to give it a 5 star yet since its still new and I haven't explore much of its use and features.;
It's great but hashtags are needed;
The condom broke, this was a mistake;
Better than Twitter;
wanna copy twitter but loooks like the comments on Instagram but without a picture LOL;
Pretty good.;
"Unable to log in. ""Unknown network error."" Uninstalled.";
It's just a worse version of Instagram;
Poor comparison/ competitor to Twitter. This app feels rushed and there's little to no unique features to use. A lot more needs to be done before I reconsider using this again.;
Get friend video Public City virus;
Not useful, Threads is again promoting useless content like Instagram.;
Don't use this application;
Pale Twitter imitation;
Not able to search for an specific topic... hey Zuck, why did you bother to release this crapp?;
The app feels like Jail with restrictions...can't follow..can't post..the restrictions stays for more than weeks...and this app wants user engagement.It is like you are playing in a Playground where you cannot use Props beyond just once or twice ..Uninstalling as it is costing my time and patience...;
Awsome app;
not promising enough;
I like it way better than twitter oh I mean x;

✨❤👍🏻;
Very poor;
Taslima;
Lovely Application;
Love it 💙💙💙;
Have to improve more, it's almost same as X.;
It's a want to be twitter;
👌👌👌;
Good;
worst app;
Please add save photo features, so i can save photos on this threads app.;
Nice copy zuck;
need more bug fix!;
Useless;
Хєротєнь. Сподіваємось, з'явиться нормальне шось;
Read my threads @arvinshouse;
Blinking problem;
I can't go through registration. It's write about unexpected error.;
Worst copycat;
Absolute piece of dog sh;
Super;
Poor app;
Useless;
Isn't it obvious;
𝑮𝒐𝒐𝒅;
Not much to read yet;
"""Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again"" My posts never go through. They're stuck in posting for days. When I follow notifications to the app it always goes to the app and then gives me an error message instead of showing me a new post or profile or whatever the notification was about. I honestly don't know how anyone is even using this app.";
Useless;
Very bad experience;
I have no words;
Great 👍;
Pasand nei h;
No one like my posts 🖕you joking mate 🤬🤬;
Okay;
Good app;
🗿;
Not worth having it take up storage space.;
This app is a pure copy of Twitter. But the algorithm of promoting new user is worst and no sense. I'm trying to grow since 2-3 weeks but this app is not working properly.;
horrible;
if worst had a face 😂😂;
In the search tab, why can't you search for a topic? Why can you only search users? When I use twitter, 99% of the time I search for topics, not othe users.;
it's a good apps & easy to use, but need message & story options;
Make a lite version please!;
so bad i don't recommend you downloading this app;
Super 💞;
It's is not like Twitter. It actually seems good by features but it is just a cheap and fail copy of Twitter, now know as X.;
Very bad app. Less features;
🙏 Thankyou so much threads team 🙏;
😾👎🏼👎🏼;
Deepkmanjhi;
Horrible. Seems like a cheap copy of X.;
Totali time Westin app;
Love 🥰;
Copy products;
User should be able to delete Threads account separately (without deleting original Instagram account);
They called it Twitter's rival but I really don't think so it's a Twitter's rival.;
There are only brands here, no real people ☠️;
The app is really slow comparing it to Instagram and twitter;
For an app that's trying to replace Twitter it sure sucks at copying twitter;
Control c. Control v=threds;
You must be on Instagram. I will never do such.;
After downloading this app, I realized that I do not need it at all.;
⚡⚡⚡;
X better;
I am humble to bring the words of God to each one; where ever you are in jesus name. Amen FROM ARUBA ISLAND.
Don't copy. Be unique.;
I'm enjoying Threads. As more and more journalists and interesting people join, I look forward to new features appearing, which will cement its place as a go to app.;
No me gusta, pensé que sería como twitter pero es sólo una extensión molesta y simplona de instagram, de paso que no trabaja bien la app. Zzzzzzzzzzz;
The app crashes when I try to open from this morning.;
It's like a house without furniture!;
It is o.k. similar to Twitter but for some reason I done three unintstalls and installs and have not gotten the updated features as advertised. So not that exciting for me.;
Boring;
The best and pictures and videos plus content is good;
What a terrible app it's not even functional and there's so many errors I will never install this ever again in the underwater area and that I would have gave you 0 Stars if I really could this is literally a wannabe Reddit and also the app keeps on closing out and I read through all your privacy policies it's ten times worse than Instagram do better;
Plain and boring - whats the point besides data collection and showing ads? There's no dark mode. This app doesn't seem to offer anything new.;
Ugh;
So boring;
The app does not offer anything new.;
Bad just wasting time;
👌🏼;
Just a copy paste of Twitter X. No use for this app. .no real issues will be discussed on this app. Only nonsense;
Why is my thread not uploaded It shows failed to upload I can't even drop some comments;
...I gave in.;
so many bugs in this app;
Something went wrong bug keeps coming back;
🥰😘😘🥰🥰🥰🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃😄;
Nice app. Restrictions will only force people to use the normal IG app though.;
Haya bina ila mondial haya bina hadari opa opaaapapaaa hadaf 9atil;
Zero stars for this app;
Why can't we chat on threads;
It is disgusting... Update it ... It need a lot of work .... Following feed back problem.... login problem.... And many more ......;
bad;
Nice aap ko na mng you have any oo no yarr pleae respect Modi;
Goooooood;
This app post is nice. This doesn't have a hashtag, poll, and edit.;
Why tp delete Instagram account for thread;
App don't turn with tablet or phone. Why? Missing feature of app...;
Suddenly when launched it minimizes itself and a pop up error says it keeps closing.;
Please put a dark mode option in the settings. Too bright for me.;
It *looks* good but that's where it stops. It works but most basic settings that you should be able to change in app, you have to change in Instagram which is not very user friendly. Honestly this app could've used an extra week or two in development before it launched.;
Not useful;
Nice 👍🏻;
A bit weird to use;
vrry bad app not good experience i will say they can,t compare to x;
Copycat.;
Useless app.;
nice;
Not bad;
😒;
Dead app;
Great app ❤️;
Even though we have to pay for an add free app and the annoying recommendations I love the app.;
😎;
Useless like facebook;
UMA COPIA BARATA DO TWITTER KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK;
Basic, boring, bland.;
Faltu;
Ugh, I wanted this to be the Twitter killer . . . What's really sad is their team is probably bigger than Twitter as well . . . C'mon Zucker, get it together man!;
I keep on trying to download it and it says TRY AGAIN .😏;
Typical bad app;
Nice app;
vh;
Faug game 2.0 Those who know know 😌;
"Better than my X. But... please change the logo from black and white - it's very hard to spot, looks too much like a lot of apps I don't look at very often. I suggest using the black background and coloured Instagram transition on the ""thread"", the same way the logo is on the apps startup screen. Then it'll stand out more amongst other apps. The whole meta branding could do with an overhaul to show their connections to one another, tbh.";
Decent, but needs work. I particularly don't like that I see all these accounts I don't follow. Seems pointless to follow anyone if you're going to see the entire world whether you want to or not.;
I can kinda post me on it...!! 🤞🏻❤️;
Osm;
Super;
Hi jay Shri ram 🚩🚩🚩;
Waste of time using threads 👎👎;
Not bad but i don't like😐;
A garbage ripoff off Twitter without the boots on the ground approach to newsworthy events.;
Nice app but need some more improvement;
Nice;
I think that is a good platform for newusers ,;
Ins;
I recommend this app great app;
Beautiful i love it;
Faltu;
Useless app🤮🤮🤮🤮;
Everything is copied;
Good;
💥💥☀️☀️;
Threads is good app;
Wonderful!;
i wish meta would just cease to exist;
💯;
Bakwas copy;
Waste app....;
Wow;
I really wish that I could view Threads on my computer where it is much easier to see and to type in responses/comments.;
Meh;
🥰🥰🥰🥰;
Please;
I have to sign up for another app (Instagram) to log into this social network? No thanks. Deleting before I even get to use the app.;
Edited my last review. Was having problems with not being able to post anything but after sending a support ticket, it's now been fixed.;
good apps;
This is the worse experience off using this threads.... I cannot log out and uninstall this apk because too do so I have to uninstall my deactive my Instagram account...😭😭;
Super;
santosh Kuma;
Nice 🎉❤️;
It feels like you've shot your load too early, trying to capitalise on the Twitter situation. Lots of work needed. My timeline is pretty empty. Shame.;
NICE APP;
You should let us give the liberty to keep Threads app or not. I want to delete my Threads account out of privacy reasons, but you guys have made us to choose to delete Instagram too which is in sync with Threads. So uncool service from Meta! I dont want to see contents from people who I dont follow, but its annoying to see things like these in my feed.;
Worst;
Very nice apps;
Add direct messages!;
👍;
Great app. Very calm and chill community compared to other questionable apps.;
"Absolute breath of fresh air! A couple of features to be developed, then it'll kill off Tw*tter - sorry ""X"" - altogether.";
💯;
So far loving it;
My accaAaqq;
Super app;
It's like using Instagram not Twitter seriously there is no compitition between Twitter and threads, what's the motive to even make this app morons cuz already Instagram exists.;
💓;
👍;
So far loves threads, has much more for a community feel to it than twitter!;
Copy of twitter;
This app have so much problems . Not refresh fast;
Actually I don't know how to use it;
Discomfort with scrolling app. Auto sound is off. In searching option pls put what is trending and reels..;
Ye apps ekdm kharab hai or agar ispe koi I'd bna lo to ye apps us I'd ko hi ban kr deta hai;
This is very slow apps,nd borrying;
😀🤤😂😂;
Nice 🙂👍;
Bad experience 😔;
Top;
SB;
Cheap Markuu Twitter Clone Fake App :3;
I love instagram📷🤳;
😒;
Nice follow me vivekmishra3344 on Instagram;
Just an alternative to Twitter..... boycott social media;
Small number of followers may see the post also followers may see post for first 60mins after posted then can't be shown, this may result reducing number of followers who are engaging....and the app seam to be boring....;
I love this app so much and I love you too .........................💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕🇮🇳;
Threads from meta:NO Twitter from meta:YES😂😂;
Very Good application for Bollywood industry thanks 👍👍👍;
So another app that hates freedom of speech and loves to delete content according to thier agenda in the name of community guidelines 🙂;
Love theads ..;
Obscene data collection practices.;
In this app I can't msg anyone ☹️;
I can't even use the app unless I have an Instagram. It's cool you could transfer everything over from it but how's this more acceptable than Twitter? I can't just sine up. Also meta owns it all so why not also connect it threw fb as well? So my problem is I jut can't flat out use the app. Witch if you want to grow the platform why put up a weird gate block.;
Good..!!;
All posts and texts are overlapping on each other.;
twitter 2.0;
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE;
Barely functional. Search is pathetic. Being able to follow actual threads is not simple. It's just a cynical attempt to capture the twitter disillusioned.;
Ok;
If you want to go back to the 2010 then install this app. Old-school and boring;
A Class....;
👍👍;
Mediocre at best. It's impossible to get exposure for your profile without spam liking comments or following people. And for the love of God, will you please allow the use of hashtags?;
It's a copycat app that offers nothing new, nothing different. It's also unethical to be using a stolen app. Uninstalled.;
5 🌟 for mark Zuckerberg 💗;
It's like Twitter, but lacking all the features and adding in a bunch of junk posts in your feed from places you don't follow.;
Bro thought he could replace Twitter. But bro fell off fast 😂;
Best experience ,edit button is a need;
still no way to see following feed;
I don't understand the point of this app. Doesn't seem much different than Instagram.;
Ki zebi;
Very very nice app very BEST app;
Osm😘🥰😂😋😊🥹😔👍😌🤤🥰🥹🙃😌😗;
I really really want to like this app, but it feels like it was rushed out and misses out on features that would make it a great app, and that is having a real time news section.;
Best app as compare to twitter 🥰;
Hhh;
Veri nice;
❤️‍🩹;
I can't give this app 1 star, Because this app is very degrading.;
Super;
Nice app @santuadhikari26;
dark mode?? + my prob with (bluebird app) is that i cant search posts with particular captions like how i did before, i wished that this app wouldve that feature but there's none as well;
Gk;
giving one star to join the crowd, I have not even used the app 👍;
Not bad;
There are a lot of bugs.;
keep it unreleased;
不喜歡，人們在這個APP上使用的風氣佈滿嘲諷、抱怨、自以為幽默...;
This is awesome;
👉💓👈 💓 👆;
Good app;
As soon as I logged into it it said someone logged into my Instagram account the only way I got it back was from Facebook I do not trust this app at all;
Supar 🤗 app;
Jyada kuchh fark nhi hai . Same hi hai instagram aur threads. sirf taxt ka otion extra hai. Otherwis nothing special;
Don't use threads because when we Uninstall threads our instagram account has been removed;
huuii;
Bahut hi kantap appp hai;
Backwash;
Good;
this app needs hashtags. it's literaly the only social media app without them. it's 2023, meta, come on.;
Scrolling can be better.;
Thik ha;
"It cant work. ""Page isn't available right now. This may be because of a technical error that we're working to get fixed. Try reloading thispage.""";
Very good app i am happy;
स्टाग्राम डाउनलोड नहीं करना ना ता पागल हो जाएगा;
Yah kya hai usse kya ho sakta hai is app se 😲😲😲😲;
Very good app;
I do not want to use the pp on my phone. I want to use the app on my desktop. Since I can not, I give this a 1;
Good;
New app new threads class app made by Facebook;
twitter > thread;
Super nice;
Thanks bro Instagram ID Ranjeetbhai6171 Follow karo;
I think as a starter u are doing great but I will like it if thread app have a space just like Twitter I will be so glad;
there's no chat;
This is fantastic app;
N It copy of Twitter 🤨;
Find your followers whos hoe many members following u in instagram and this threads app using are easy also;
This isn't an X killer;
It just like Twitter;
Hope you can minimize the threads of accounts that we do not follow.;
I'm ratin the app before opening it up 😂😂😂🥇;
Should add more feature, like hashtags and a home of trending news in that territory 🪡🧵;
Good;
Doesn't work. Worked when joined now it doesn't unable to comment or post.. submitted report which apparently not submitted. What is this?? Checked with friends and theirs is working fin. How to fix this?;
Please available Reels feature....I am not using Instagram but i like to watch Reels so please add reels as soon as possible...😀;
در هر صورت مثل توییتر گیج کننده است;
Doesn't even work.. I cannot get past the password stage. I guess that's my sign. Thank you for letting me try it.;
"Always show ""Sorry, something went wrong, Try again"" when I click posts. Something always went wrong when I open someone's main. I can't even post anything.";
Good 👍;
Not good;
Soumitra Jana;

Hello Instagram I am impress this is app is very best good app all countries the good app thank you for Instagram;

Super app;
Good;
خمسة نجوم اتمناا ان يكون التطبيق جيدااا;
Op;
Super 👌🏻;
This is waste,Twitter superb;
Worst;
The problem seems to be fixed, but I lost followers because of it.;
Unreal got rid of my pictures 📸;
I love it@;
Boring;
It's been weeks. Meta has no intention of fixing anything. I'm uninstalling.;
Copied, waste of time, of no use!!;
I support Elon that's why I rated it 1 star;
Useless app, copy of X worst app.;
Cannot set username;
Veri nice;
Good App Give trend feature;
Good;
Best app ilove this;
good;
Good;
i like you very much;
Very worst!;
Best application;
Too many bugs.. Twitter is better;
Poor add download they misbehave afterwards;
Follow me;
It's a waste of time;
Basti;
کخ کخ;
This app r@@pes the privacy, literally it asks for everything in the phone;
Trying to be like twitter but it's not...mark should comes with great ideas not making a twitter copy;
Why my Instagram chats are gone and my note are disappeared I'm just tired to Instagram errors and glitches why this happening and when this stopped errors I can't chat with my friends 😞 anymore;
😍😁;
Hi I love you too happy birthday bhaiya ji ko call kar rahe hai kya baat hai to;
Better;
Another worse product from Meta.;
Very. Good;
Doesn't work on Huawei phones;
Useless application;
Your Instagram application now very bad beacuse now massage invite option showing what is that Instagram team meta team please what you doing day by day to your application i can't understand why this do and now my account showing suspensive activities what is that i use one mobile number and one mobile why showing this your service and system not working now i hate your application now Instagram team meta team.;
Threads is not bad. But it needs few improvements like saving option. Sometimes I like a pic but can't download. Please add this feature.;
Twitter better;
Pointless.. 100 mil users as they claim but no posts or interactions, it's like 👻 app, I'm deleting it;
"None of the accounts that I follow show up in my home feed. Also, I've seen others saying you can toggle this by tapping the Threads logo at the top, but mine doesn't work that way. Apparently there's supposed to be a ""For You"" and a ""Following"" option that I don't have.";
Can't even search for threads. Only can search users. Pathetic.;
Only for showing;
Pretty good app! Like it but, not five stars yet, we want more visibility on the platform and we waiting for Hashtags!!;
Great app!!!... Looking forward for more updates;
New usage;
What is the actual point of this app? I've had no major issues using it,but I just don't 'get' it. It's pretty much twitter (sorry, X) minus a billionaire owner. I'm sure there's a long term plan in place to make this relevant. I'll keep it installed for now in the hope it does eventually find it's own identity.;
A p of s;
Best app for making new friends and meeting my soulmate;
It is a copy of twitter threr is no new feature old methods and bad per formens and no new feature.;
Too many restrictions on content , won't work with millennials or younger.;
Just a Twitter ripoff that isn't as good as Twitter;
Waste app;
GOOD;
Dark mode. Now.;
Gobar;
Nothing interesting;
Copy Paste Twitter;
Nice;
Cool;
Super intuitive and easily portable from Instagram etc. I enjoy it I just always forget to use the damn thing after the influx when it debuted!;
Nice;
Really cool different stuff;
Super;
THREADs;
Good;
Noble application.;
So I have to create an Insta as a prereq for this? I already have FB. Why isn't that enough? This is basically just Insta (fame leeches), but with another layer of exclusivity required JUST TO JOIN. I never thought I'd agree with Elon, but this is whack.;
Worst app.Twitter is the best;
An exciting new way to see Ads and posts from people you don't care about! At least you don't have to worry about seeing up any preferences.;
An app just for the beginning of fight between these 2 super power. Let it shink.;
Rubbish app;
Nice app sir;
Don't hesitate to just copy old twitter system, I know you guys need to do legal stuff incase that evil x sue you or something, but please don't give up on working on this app;
Best;
Good, but better is possible;
No option to delete account permanently, Only do deactivate temporarily.💩;
boring;
😍;
Nice;
Anyone that gave this app more than 3 stars is a bot 😅;
Nice and crisp;
The worst thing you can do is try it. When I subscribed, it was nice, but after that, it's not important, and why can't I cancel my account other than when I cancel my Instagram account, it's much better. This is my opinion.;
Ain't no way Instagram just directly tried to copy another app;
Os;
I like this app;
Its just not Musky enough for me.;
Nice 👏👏🔥🔥🔥;
Best app;
Why do I need an Instagram account in order to create an account? Why would you decide on such a stupid decision. Needless to say I'm not (can't) signing up.;
Poor app;
Good aap;
Why when i share my tread on instagram it show how much the likes i've got in threads on the picture? Its look cheesy.;
it's a gorgeus one i really love it..✨;
Wrost app;
Writer;
Good you aap;
Threads is like baking a cake, pulling it out of the oven when it's clearly undercooked, and serving it without icing or any toppings. Should have kept this in the oven for an extra year;
بجربه;
Osm;
I love it 💞;
Copy of Twitter hahaha lol;
People want to leave twitter for this waste of time?;
Not satisfied why this app...;
Vain;
Nice;
Love it;
i wish threads have a save button for images and videos. i would like to save the memes. plssss consider this proposition. thank you.;
Weak copy of Twitter;
Good;
Clone app;
Nice;
Competition is fair, cheating is not.;
Sumit bhai;
Making other apps run slower or crashing them. Delete threads and everything works fine. Update. Definitely interfering with other app. Not going back on my phone until it's sorted.;
It's good, likely Instagram;
This knock off app broke my phone?;
Boring;
I.am vary happy in use this app;
Have it on my phone but am finding it not available for PC. I prefer using my PC for internet stuff, makes no sense I can't use it on the computer;
Great thanks;
Better than Twitter. Very easy to use. I give it 4 stars because it needs more improvement.;
The screen is blurring. I cant see anything. If i try to slide the screen, it doesnt work. Help me.;
Thread post is not posting on instagram's feed;
Where is dm opsn;
BAd app;
Not bad to start.;
Predatory tracking and data harvesting. Slow UI, lack of decent feed algorithms, and slow-rolling feature updates that barely match competitor apps.;
good;
Not samthing;
So far so good;
Need to improve the search feature. Cant find relevant threads. Just a bunch of accounts.;
Worst App.. No Views On Post.. Even Post Dont Reach on Follower's Timeline.. Wastage of time.. nothing is useful or entertaining..;
Allow to create account even if do not have Instagram account.;
Whats do you thank?;
BKbaas app;
Like this App;
I don't have a problem with this app. It's still growing and it's still a good app in my opinion. I believe that major things will happen once they keep developing. Just need to be patient and wait and see...;
So far I like. Needs a lil more juice though.;
I literally can't use the app. It won't let me search, post, or look at the notifications. All I can do is scroll on the feed until it stops and buffers. I have tried force stopping, uninstalling and reinstalling, and going online to find solutions. Can't do anything now but sometimes scroll through the feed before it locks or freezes. Thanks Meta 👍🏻;
Super;
Twitter trash copy;
Collecting so much user information. Why don't they just come and live in my home if they want to know everything about my private life.;
Having issues uploading more than two pics at once; keeps on failing. Otherwise no issues.
Twitter but 1984;
Broken threads;
After using this app i actually realised the value of twitter.;
Too basic no save photo feature no way to search tops at all . The interfaces is ugly and barely functional big flop . If I could put 0 stars I would .;
Threads;
It is promising....my money is on Zuck;
Threads will replace X soon;
Very Good;
Esta aplicacion esta muy lenta al subir mis publicaciones y como hace parte de instagram que siempre tiene fallos al actualizarse perderan un usuario de esta aplicacion tambien;
Updates very fast no single day;
Deletes all your messages from IG when you link;
Maybe in time it'll get better;
Péssimo!;
"It's literally a twitter clone... only, it's a safe space for easily offended vegan rich left wing kids. It was supposed to be the ""twitter killer"" but tanked so epically, like the failed Facebook satellite... exploded shortly after lift-off haha! Useless app riddled in censorship.";
Similar to Twitter but not as useful for me, using threads requires downloading the app again and only takes up memory.;
Better than Twitter;
great;
We need hashtag #️⃣;
Salu Thakor 4189;
It crashed since yesterday and its no longer working.;
Nice aap;
Don't know yet but I'm sure I'll get some answers about Anthony buttuafuaco thank u;
Can't be better than X;
Useless app;
Most powerful than app 😁;
You can only sign up through your Instagram account, and you have to delete your Instagram account if you no longer want Threads. Too abusive. And the timeline is full of influencers, paid I presumed. I chose to lose my Instagram account rather than keep this app.;
Royal surya Singham;
Mst AAP;
Lizard guy ban my account;
Disgusting.;
No freedom of speech;
Disgusting;
Best app;
Data waste nothing excited;
Good 💯;
Sonu kumar;
Alright;
a good app;
Excellent;
تطبيق جدًا عادي.;
Rubbish, no search facility to find anything, so back to Twitter it is.;
Twitter rules;
Ok 🆗 nice application 👍👍👍😊😊;
Should be able to delete threads account completely, turns out you'd have to delete your whole Instagram account to get threads account deleted. There is a faulty option to deactivate but yada yada Would be ideal if it was not a forced keep, also a complete rip of Twitter. 😂 this is💩;
Nice app;
Will never use Lizard guys's app even if Twitter(X) went bankrupt.;
Nice 🙂;
👍 nice;
Lame;
It's a pretty good app it's pretty much like twitter. It's got alot of options and everyone you follow on Instagram you can follow!! Also you don't have to create a profile sense it uses you Instagram one!;
Very bad service you're account link to Instagram and similar to insta No audio in video;
ONE OF THE WORST APP IN SOCIAL HISTORY. KINDLY DELETE IT !!;
Flop;
Thread is Threat.;
Poor bad app don't install your phone;
I was unable to download this app it's so annoying 😢;
Bad;
Rubbish;
This is app is best on social media app and it's can also use easy;
Fake copy;
Cheap copy.......... Mark Zuckerberg Please use your brain sometimes. Stop stealing ideas from others.;
Disgusting. Twitter is a lot better.;
probably the worst app currently existing in the world. needs a ton of improvement. While scrolling, if a text is slightly touched, it remains with copy icon and stays same even after several times scrolling, very annoying with a copy icon. Please add a save to phone option for the photos because after touching the photo, no option is there, looks very basic. AI suggestions for the post are worse than any other apps.;
Nice app;
OK. Dump Twitter;
Trash;
Much better than twitter;
X wannabe. This is the most Meta app ever literally stole the concept of Twitter and improved nothing. Garbage app;
It’s good ✨;
Wast app;
Okay sagar;
Don't copy other's work;
Qane ilova;
Copycat booooooo 👎;
a bad copy of Twitter;
Nice;
EVENLY CLEAR>>>.;
Vikashraj;
Definitely in need of some key features but I'm happy so far!;
Waste of time 😭;
Love you 🌹🌹❤️❤️🤗🤗;
This app is very bad;
B BP;
This app is amazing 😍;
Very very good;
Really wanted to like this app but when you can't upload anything after clearing data and installing a fresh new install it really takes away from it. FIX THIS. You want people to move from Twitter to this and it's not even functional;
Good 😊;
Very nice app;
Won't give me a sign up option.;
Didn’t like. 🤷‍♀️;
SENSOR, NO PRIVACY, WEF, WOKE;
It's Instagram's Twitter. Haven't used it much, but a big gripe for me is you have to manually log out to switch between accounts, unlike the app's sister or basis. It's pretty annoying.;
very very good #ga3mi_021 #ga3mi_021 #ga3mi_021;
عالیه;
THREADS IS DEAD. ZUCKTHECUCK Deserves the absolute worst karma possible, he and his. People finding out the hard way why monopolies are bad for the world.;
Was excited to see a Twitter alternative but I'm not able to get in. Instagram demands that I upload a photo of my face and my hand like a 1970s kidnap victim to prove that I'm alive and I refuse to do that. Already gave you my phone number, which BTW is also none of your business. I have been on FB without issues for 15 years. Until you stop with this selfie nonsense on Instagram and Threads I'll stay out.;
I love it;
Twitter is best;
Software engineer;
zucc;
Best app Ever its 💯 percent better than Twitter you get followers quicker and meet new people and become friends;
Sorry, something went wrong. Try again.;
Awsome;
Good😃👍;
Just a bad version of Twitter.;
Nyc interface same like a Twitter but its better than Twitter.;
Threads is thread bare when it comes to having the same key funcations as Twitter (X). Having no way to seach for key works makes finding profiles of random users a pain. Not being able to view your likes is also a pain. I will give credit that it now shows people you're following in a different tab. I still feel like there is a long way to go before the application is ready for the primetime.;
I love it;
Terrible;
The point of this app is to do what? Will reinstall when I find out.;
Decent app. Going to take a bit to get going.;
looking forward to a PC-usable version, rather than just phone/tablet/Chromebook;
Thee best;
Not quite the Twitter replacement it could be just yet, a lot of basic features are missing on top of being tied to Instagram and owned by Meta. But it's already a lot less toxic than Twitter.;
Best fiture in insta;
This app sucks. I got bent over and spanked by Daddy Elon for telling somebody to kys, so now I can't tweet for a week. I thought I'd give Threads a try, and I used it for less than five minutes before deleting it. I guess I'll just have to talk to people in real life instead...;
Bad app;
Thank you for your amazing services!;
Need more options like hashtag supports .;
Worst;
Signup doesn't work;
Jujice;
Hhh;
Get in here;
Difficult in refreshing the page for new post. The following and followers too aint clear, a twitter/ X following & followers model wouldn't be bad. Overall am totally disappointed in this app. Not a good app.;
No images, video download option. Can't zoom pictures it automatically zooms out.;
So boring.... Nothing to do here. If i have to rate it out of 10.... Then if possible... I will give it zero.;
Jvi;
😏😏😏;
Good;
I want to like this app. I refuse to use Twitter, and I was desperate for an alternative. I keep hearing about the following tab but have yet to see that update on my phone.;
I like it.;
Not support desktop user. Super trash;
sorry mark, tapi menurut gue the winner is twitter 👌🏻;
It's fine but app crashes sometimes;
Worst app don't downloade;
Mast app;
It wouldn't be hard to surpass Twitter imo. Just the simple features and none of the nonsense. DM's, quote tweets, trending page, likes tab, media tab. Need these;
I was pleasantly surprised, the feed is very basic and minimalist but in a way I prefer, you don't constantly get bombarded with advertisements. Obviously there's still a few teething issues but overall it performs well enough.;
Copy of twitter;
Good;
YEAAAAAAH 👍👌;
Aaa thu;
nice App 👍;
Nice👏👏👏;
You need an Instagram account to use this. I don't want an Instagram account so back to twitter I go.;
One hit wonder;
Twitter>>>>>;
I don't want it to be linked with my Instagram account.;
Very bad rating;

Twitter for life Edit(X for life);
I use this app regularly, but I do think that if the creators want to keep this app alive, you have to implement some new features that other basic social media apps already have. Like saving/bookmarking, having an explore page where it's not just rando's accounts showing up on ur timeline (it's always posts I don't care about popping up on here like old Facebook memes or religious quotes). A #tag feature wouldn't hurt either. Also the video format here sucks (+ let me zoom in on photos).;
Stupid attempt to copy Twitter;
Just another online space for the dumb, easily manipulated masses. Zero free speech and tailored feeds to continue the relentless brainwashing of the feeble minded.;
Left-wing ranting. Mind you, the alternative is right-wing ranting so it really comes down to what flavour of rage you're into.;
Very lag very bad. In short copy of twitter;
Best app and faster to use;
This is nice;
Nice 👍;
Es ist am besten;
Feed is cluttered with posts from accounts I don't follow and most likely have no intention of following. Update: There is improvement, but I am still seeing some posts from accounts I don't follow.;
Threads, an Instagram app is not good for World!;
It's a good app and i like it but this app not have a messenger. In my opinion what if there is messenger i think everyone will go for it otherwise the Threads is amazing.;
I like this and beautiful ui but have problem can you add hastag and treading hastag on your platform plz thank you I hope can you fix this problem;
لا يوجد به أي شيء جديد أو مختلف عن تويتر او انستجرام! للاسف uninstall;
♥️;
Why do I get this 😂😂😂 Not permitted Sorry, your account does not meet the requirements to use Threads. Try logging in with a different account.;
Twitter best!!;
Won't open the app;
Llllllll lak jao remix fon;
hey maybe don't refresh everything when the app is just idle so I can keep looking at what I was seeing thanks, otherwise pretty standard;
it is not available on web , some errors occured when posting a thread, search option is also missing;
Bad, everything is censored as if this was a cyberpunk dystopia;
Nice;
People don't seem to use it alot .;
🔥🔥;

Tweeter is the best;
Its Copied App So.;
Pointless wannabe twitter;
Worst app ever i have use;
Trash;
Super app;
This app is amazing ❣️💯;
Copy 😂;
not very intuitive, i just want to see feeds from people i follow. if not, a separate news feed is needed. they should've implemented these when they launched to keep up with twitter. now the fomo has died, and people are going back to twitter.;
Very bad graphics and esp fonts i don't recommend using this app lol;
Good 😊👍;
Did twitter changed its name or what?;
Op;
This app is so boring and lacks creativity;
Very good application;
Not ready yet? Overall feels like a cheap clone of Twitter. The app is incredibly lagy, and the community isn't as strong as on other platforms. I would try it again at a later time, which timings would have been smoothed out.;
No use for this app;
It's good;
The best social app;
Trash version of Elon's x known as Twitter. I'd delete my account, but I think they forced me to link it to insta otherwise it would be gone. Plus this app doesn't promote free speech for everyone. Forced me to look at content I wasn't following. Just don't get this app. Stick to instagram, fb, or x/twitter.;
Easy app 👍;
I think the app is great but if you made it video only but with the same interface as Instagram and the videos be 6 seconds long it would be great cuz it would be like vine 2.0;
Yeah. Musk bought Twitter in billions and you cheated to creat this. You must be ashamed.;
better than Twitter #ZuckerbergTeam;
"""Sorry, something went wrong. Try again"" - Every feature of this app. In other words, not usable until this bug gets fixed.";
It's worth being suspended from Twitter. GIFS! GIFS GIFS GIFS!!!!!!;
Aburrida y decepcionante.;
"""Twitter Killer""";
✨🦦;
Good;
Sani;
News censorship and sanitized conversations.;
At first it is okay . But now I can't seem to post anything on threads also I cant see any of my previous post on threads it keeps saying try again later. I tried to uninstall the app and re installed again but it is still the same. Please do fix this bug issue. I already report on threads.;
Certainly superior to Twatter, and less toxic.;
Useless;
Would love the option to easily switch between accounts like you can on Instagram.;
Twitter is better;
Good;
The app is good and useful for the app but don't have a download option no more then if you can do quick this app now thank you🌹🌹❤❤.;

It works well, engagement is better than it's ever been on xTwitter and the algorithm keeps my feed full of creative, political and quality Threads. Bugs are fixed quickly and currently it's really stable. I'm connected to an amazing community. And no MAGA-Nazis.;
nice app;
Superb 👌👌🤗 🤗;
Horrible, every random threads pops up on my feed, cant even see threads from people i follow. No options to see threads only i follow. Horrible app even after they copied twitter, made it worse;
ankittheyido 4;
បង យ៉ាBee 🐝 ✨️ Mexico 👌;
beyond just missing a million features the entire vibe sucks because the feed algorithm sucks and it feels like they're desperate to shove celebrities and brands in your face so maybe there's something to look at instead of being a useful community and friend fostering app;
Nice.....but....;
Very good;
A non useful app. A copy of Instagram of Instagram. Why would I use thread n not Instagram. Not great.;
Useless;
They tried, and it's incomplete.;

Meh about like everything else;
❤️❤️❤️;
Super 👍;
It's fantastic;
Haa k,;
❤️;
Love it. Nice ❤️🤗👏👍;
threads post add song feature;
The app doesn't support all type of images. In my experience it doesn't accept .png which it should.;
Supra;
I would like to see a few minor upgrades such as the ability to enter a gif on the fly and the ability to click on a word and not have to backspace to make a correction. Other than that so far so good 👍🏻;

Don't like;

Very wonderful;
Can you do a double tap on a photo or video to like it, like on Instagram?;
GB Jun gn;
Won't use it until there's a dark mode option for mobile, no app is worth getting heads over just to look at. I can't use the dark mode phone setting because it interferes with other settings so while I like the initial set up it's a no from me until then.;
Love this app;
سيئ جداً ليحيى إكس;

Zuck is a mf assasin of free speech, a cheater and far more worse than evil.;
Stupid app don't waste your time on it;
After all that hype ,It's boring now.;
Completely pointless app. It just copies all the exact same posts from Instagram and pastes them here. I don't need 2 apps for the same thing.;
Best;
Baaaad;
I get how the vibes when it's first came out, but slowly it's just another platform for Insagram user to post. nothing special, and no new features, nor even the innovations. just plain old social media that mostly text-posting with less features than it's rival.;
Andrew Tate said it is a gay app that's why I am giving it a one star;
As soon as they add direct messaging to the app, it'll be the #1 social media platform I use. Really enjoying the quick updates, adding features pretty much every week. It's been nice actually talking to people again.;
So there been improvements, still lacking hashtags, trends, proper search feature & a better way to refresh timeline. I hope the api allows weather & the like to update people.;
Guys i wish the thread order would add newest replys to the bottom. im using reply to my own thread to expand on content (but it adds the last reply to the top automatically) and it doesnt make sense to read... Or allow users to slide replies up and down and arrange to our liking. Thank you;
A copy of Twitter;
Threads is gay use twitter Elon musk ❤️❤️❤️ (Elon musk didnt say this I just love him);
Good apps;
I'm glad to hear that Threads, the Instagram app, has received positive reviews in 2023. It seems like the app's updates and features are resonating well with users. If you have any specific questions or topics you'd like to discuss about Threads, feel free to let me know!;
Good luck;
❤️❤️❤️;
don't download threads and link it with your instagram account. it's a total mistake because if you delete threads well then... yeah..;
Twitter is the best;
Hera india is a local slot a hemp skemp with freaks such a low life with chains;

I like thread because it can use easily.;
It's a very poorly worsted app 😡 Very poor version;
Reliable social media platform entertainment base content;
It won't let me deactivate my account;
Threads is very cool app 😎 On this app we can post our feelings quotes 😌 I read quotes on Threads and I enjoy this app ✨;
This app is not human friendly. It does not provide a good interface. Change it or delete it worst app ever.;
Love it 😆😍;
Vishal fitness;

Enjoying seeing threads evolve and improve.;
Well done and kudos. You can do better, make all features on Instagram and Facebook available on it for creators. A lot to be fixed and done. You know better.;
Pictured not showing;
This app is so buggy and slow;
Very bad experience with this app just a photo copy 😡;
Unnecessary;
Twitter is much better.;
It's good but not the best;
Nice;
Bad app;
I only want to see posts from the accounts i follow. I'm interested in others posts. Add Following tab in Timeline.;
@🤙🏾;
It's better than Twitter🤔;
Brilliant if you hate yourself and want to give all of your contacts and your own data to a predatory company favoured by extremists. Facebook will claim mastodon integration but censor and restrict what their users can see.;
😒;
copycat lol;
So hot right+? ... Another trash to try to replace Twitter crisis since Musk bought it. Don't fall for it. Instagram wasn't their idead, neither WhatsApp, Facebook story is complex, it was from a colleague of Zuckerberg. Meta is a failure. Incredible how people are manipulable.;
0 star Copy of Twitter Mark Zuckerberg 👎👎👎👎👎;
I logged out of my account now this app wont log back in even though im filling in my correct details it keeps showing an error what is wrong here;
vvvvvvv good;
🤝🏻;
Better than twitter or x or whatever that elon guy has called it;
It steals my information and sells it to the cia, don't download it guys;
T be sad feed;
X is better;
Regrettably, I can't rate the Thread app higher than 1 star. Its cluttered interface, consistent lag, and frequent crashes severely hinder communication efficiency. Essential features like customizable notifications and search are surprisingly absent, while the lack of responsive customer support leaves users stranded. A disappointing experience overall.;

Nice app new and good;

My account is not permitted all that because I give one star before downloading. You guys are nuts. Why the f I'm not permitted. Have i done something that upsets Zuck the emperor.;
New app but but good for the business;
I rate this 0 🙂 bcz i love Instagram the most but this is wrost app🥲 i uninstall it but somehow i know tha deleting threds automaticly delete Instagram 🙂 whyyyyyy?????;

Nice;
Meh.;

This app is Great, But I think I got Notification delays From this App and Googling Doesn't know what I'm Talking about please fix It;
Good 😊;
Very nice;
Threads ❤️ good 💯☺️🤗❤️;
Several opportunities with this. 1... Must be an Instagram user... Really? While I am, that's the worst aspect of this app right from the beginning. Any app that forces the use of another is terrible. 2. Search function is the absolute worst. No way to find things you truly wish to other than find things similar and then proceed from there. 3... Give it one week and you'll discover this is a very poorly executed idea. The only app this competes with is MySpace or Xanga, certainly nothing now.;
Usual aap;
ammazing;
😍😍😍;
Hacked immediately maybe my see critters 😭;
🎉🎊;
I cant log on! Thanks for nothing!;
Unlink it From Instagram it should not block people on insta too if we block people on threads PLSS.;
W Elon musk;
Trashy app.;
The safest app I been on;
Worst app;
Love this app;

Boringggg. Twitter is still better because of their lenient policy. This is much more of a kiddy version of Twitter. Not at all interesting.;
🥰;

"We can't delete profile Once Create I Known It's Linked To Instagram But One Need Can Do Perform One Action"" Urge To Delete Whole App So Better Than…Do Option to Delete Profile Only🤪 Moving To The Next Part, less features compared to Twitter & once the app have crash Issue While Using Auto Close.";
Instagram se related bahut achcha hai yah;
You can never replace what Twitter had. Not the same experience and a waste of time.;
My thread badge number is display now I can't get it back I need my badge number back @tazimhayeat;
Pathetic Experience Twitter is way better;
9 out of 10;
🤢🤢🤢🤢;
Nice app;
This app is a complete disaster! No privacy, zero control, and an unstable mess. Zuckerberg's blatant disregard for user privacy is appalling. The app collects and exploits personal data without shame. It's a hacker's paradise. The tyrannical controlled environment stifles freedom of expression. Dissenting opinions are crushed. The app is an alpha-like mess, lacking essential functions and stability. Avoid this privacy nightmare! Zuckerberg should be ashamed.;
Please update the algos of the app. It looks boring and very black interface.. Use colours cause it is boring;
tati;
I like the app, but just a few days after launch, the app changed for the worst. Now you only see famous people thread instead of regular people. The app lacks a lot of things that Twitter has/had. It does have potential but not for me.;
There's nothing special about it to say it's better than Twitter. Not yet at least;
The worst Social Network in the History of Humanity. NOBODY sees your threads! Plus it doesn't even have #. So NOBODY likes you or comment. In other words, ZERO display of your posts. WORST than Twitter!🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ That could MARK your difference! Increasing the visualisation of our posts. To gain more interactivity and likes and comments!;
Nothing but a cheap copy of Twitter.;
I'm experiencing a bit of problems with this app, as it is not user friendly. In addition it has a huge privacy issues, that the app is stressing about the usage of personal information to third-parties.;
Too many nonsense peoples posting nonsense content;
It has really great potential. But they still don't have the feed chronological? It only seems to highlight celebrities and influencer posts. Leaving most regular folk with bare minimum engagement. Which just feeds a narcissistic culture. Kinda disappointing.;
Ok👍;
App seems good, but it still doesn't allow to customize the timeline. I'd like to have a way to see only content from people I follow.;
Boring and unremarkable app;
It had some bugs but still the team is working on it to make our experience great 🤚✨;
Not that great.....Mark should not launch this kind of app out of jealousy..;
Don't copy from twitter;
Instagram without DM. What's the point. Should have made it text only. There isn't a need of images which can't be managed with image links.;
Kya gobar bana diye ho zukerberg babu 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀;
Unnecessary and useless;
Very amazing app i like it;

add trending feature like twitter;
I am downloaded this app only msd;

Good experience;

Nice aap 📌;
It's a trap i can't uninstall this app now cz it's linked to my Instagram main account, if i uninstall threads my account will deactivate... And this app is Twitter Copy stupid boring app PLEASE DON'T DOWNLOAD ⚠️🚫⛔️‼️;
Got bored quick after a few days;
Tried copying Twitter. Really messed up.;
Horrivel;
Totally copied version of Twitter 👎👎;
I used this but not properly work;
Unable to upload threads... I don't know why its not working under wifi also... I couldn't post..;
Copy of Twitter, smooth feel but old idea.;
Nice;
Wow not great copy of Twitter 🤣🤣;
Love this;
Passable, but very low on features with nothing new or innovative for this kind of app. It's like a Wish version of Twitter with nothing new brought to the table. Even the name is derivative.;
Amazing app better than Twitter;
Main Roz is per kam Karta tha aapka app bilkul bekar hai;
Where's the media Saving option????🌕;

One of the greatest app in the world;
Some comments don't show a bad app;
Hacked, with a constant circle trying to report issue, absolutely horrible no customer support no way to contact and correct;
Bad, another fake app.;
Bad app , you can't massage people;
Biggest disappointment of the year. Functionality at release is limited and not intuitively designed at all. Basically useless for socials and just a big business feed.;
I think there must be an option of delete account in this app🙂;
off-brand X;
Good;
Finally, a new and looks like a more relliable messaging app;
Let's just waste more of our time so zuck can bring in more advertising dollars. Don't think so.;
Perfect;
privacy are exploited in thread;

Is it cool but yeah you delete your thread account it automatically get deleted your Instagram account also 😔;
Jay Hind Jay Bharat Mera Bharat mahan 15 August aata hai ek Baar aake FIR chala jata hai;
Been using it for some time and there is still too much random, and the search function is more or less trash, cause it only searches for people and not content. The algorithm also sucks.;
Nice;
Lixo de aplicativo;
An awful experience when using this app is that you can't choose to see threads only from the people you care about. I don't like seeing my feed full of stuff I don't care about.;
Jahnoyduncan;
The only thing problem I have is not being able to give 5 stars for different episodes in a podcast.;
No words;
Nice app 🤘🏻 ya app bahut accha hai 🥰;
want to see content and videos i want;

Forces people to delete Instagram account to delete threads account. Should be illegal;

Pointless;

Its photo copy version and photocopy price only 1 rupees in Nepal ..;
Great apps;
When I open the app I see a thread I posted days ago or longer which always pops up. I have to click past this before I can read new posts.;
Worst u.i.;
you've been logged out of %1$s. the account owner may have changed the password,, can u repair this problem ?;
I don't like the limitations in the number of words! Please make that longer;
Yes I do like this app but hope not the bad Russia not playing about my thing;
Esme dual account nhi hai jesa ki Instagram per hai but threads an Instagram aacha hai;
Nice Threabs,;
Do not install this app This is a scam;
How;
Very waste app not compared Twitter;
Very 😞 bad;

This is a amezing;
App basically doesn't work. I can't post or repost. Have tried all the usual updates, clearing cache, reinstalling, rebooting phone etc to no avail.;

Wow nice😍😍😍;
Most worsts version of Twitter........;
First it's a copy and second it's has no new features;

Good app 💕;
I love this app. It's splendid.;
Its good;
I love bus viral kar do Bhai;
I did not like the sound on on every post;
not worth to be checked;
Most of the time, the app only shows threads from people I don't even follow and have no interest in. When I scroll to the top to view threads from only the people I follow, the option isn't there. It's super annoying and I usually close the app in under a minute. 👋;
Develop it;
Stolen app.;
excellent, despite of few bugs but it's understandable since this is just new. i suggest to add a public reach numbers/views in every post. btw, please fix every bugs asap;
Dope app;
not ok;
Disgusting;
نصب می شود ولی وصل نمی شود;
A copy of Twitter with very less to offer considering you can't really search threads nor can you tailor your feed. I'm tired of seeing unwanted threads on my feed by people I don't know;
Better than Twitter 😂;
🤢🤮;
Useless;
Poopoo;
Bad;
The most boring app I've ever used.;
Nice 👍🏻;
Fully useless;
🕉️🕉️🙏🏼;
An unnecessary waste of human potential and productivity.;
Fgl;
Bad experience;
This app is for me and I have a great time;
Seems OK usage wise.;
Worked fine for a couple of weeks then stopped displaying anything other than the feed, can't look at people's accounts, my own or anything other than the main feed. Shame, was keen to replace X, but looks like I will be stuck with it still....;
The design of the app is not good and the experience not like Twitter,;
Had to uninstall because I wasn't even able to log in again due to an error that didn't go away for weeks now;
I love you 😍;
Honestly I donwloaded the app and used for around a week or two and suddenly got my Instagram hacked. Someone changed my password so I instantly was able to change my password and log it out of any existent device. I blame Threads because of its security, because it's connected to Instagram and because we've been hearing about how our date is collected by it, opening space for actually hackers to possibly do the same, so I uninstalled. Side note, it is illigal in the EU so it must have a reason.;
Just copy past app;
Too much bad.;
Nothing interesting;
I installed this app and immediately my Instagram account was hacked,, this app is whack and should be sued for lack of data protection;
Useless;
What is the actual use of this app, the app is meaning less🤷 it just a consume your your time and internet data, I don't like the app;
❣️;
Twitter is the best;
Super;
Good 😊;
Add a double tap on the search icon bottom bar to directly search please;
Booooo 👎👎;
Best Threads;
Amazing App🥰😍😍;
Whoever made Instagram I used to love that app and now you ruined it for me thanks a lot now I can't not even talk to my friends thanks to you and I didn't mean it possibly on that post it was a joke like playing my account back so I can talk to my friends please and thank you if you be kindly to please and thank you;
App is designed to suit influencers mainly rather than the larger number of users;
"No ""following"" feed.";
Can't even search for a subject;
Bad app, is not useful;
It always glitches. You will open it for the first time in hours and the screen is stuck on a bunch of posts trying to post. Even though you posted them hours ago. The most annoying thing on an app ever! Do better threads. Because you're not coming even close to Twitter /X. Also you can't post any links. How are we supposed to share current events when you can't post links??? Also you can't # anything.. so dumb. Definitely needs so much work.;
Nada contra.;
gud;
Butf and nice 👌👌;
Never been this wanted to delete threads. Pls don't put it on Instagram.;
This app is embarrassing;
Good one but lame;
Needs to have separate feeds for followed and general news, and trending!;
Just boring as hell and missing a ton of quality of life features. Not impressed;
Following tabs is definitely an improvement but still there is no general search for posts which forces you to only see main tab;
Not as good as X this is awful;
Nice 😄 app Instagram👻;
Fantastic;
Love you too my group and Bhai jaan 😘;
Honestly, this app is a lot better than Twitter. I love that it has no tweet counts and word counts unlike Twitter.;
Nul;
this is a poor mans twitter - zucks sucks;
Cool;
Very nice Application, Everything is fine and good.;
The app is good. All is ok. But the policy that ' deleting the threads account will close your instagram as well ' is like threatening your customers to stay on this app. Mark zuckerberg should that this marketing startegy will not work for sure. And please separate it from instagram. Like every new people who doesnt have an instagram will have to create an account. Thats a very big downfall for this app. Else the app is good. Plus not replying to the reviews is also a big downfall;
There's still a lot of improvement needed, like hashtags, switching accounts easily, etc. But apart from that I'm really enjoying it.;
Lame, the app is actually very well designed imo but there's just nothing there;
🥰❤️🏋‍♂️💪;
Love it really;

This app was amazing;

Its great app like it very munch;
absolutely terrible;
Very bad application 😕;
It lacks features and just go with the brand hype move;
Worst app.;
The one of worst if not the worst 😥😥;
Good;
Nice app;
Worst app;
Uesless app no has tag no collaborate No editing no tag 😒;
Ye faltu ka app hai bin kam ka time pass se bhi kharab hai pta nhi kis liye ye app bnaya gya hai;
Reliable and good 👏;
Wow;
Account not delete;
What's the point of this app lmao;
Weird..I can't open mine even tho I updated it already?...it keeps loading..;
Lasted for a week;
Nice 👍;
"Twitter is better then this... You try your best to copy but you failed.... Just kidding 😂😂 it's easy to use, i personality like it ""if it is copy of Twitter"" then also it's great app..";
"Urrgh this app is just disaster now no dms sometimes you cant even see the people who reply to your post actually you cant even see people who reply to your post it says ""some replies aren't available learn more"" this is just pathetic fix that bug pliz its really fustrating and annoying this app needs alot of work and the features that your updating now are useless we need dms and pliz fix that comment thingie (";
Not good;
Nice app😇;
Not a attractive.;
The app is excellent. My experience with this app has been by far good enough and I must say this is not twitter but something definitely better than it;
I like it 😊;
Would be so much better if you could 'keyword search', at present there isn't much to keep people engaged on the app;
Give it a try;
Perfect;
Facebook have enough of my data, Don’t want to send more.;
I love it 💙;
Good;
✌️🥰✌️;
It's a great app and you get followers fast🥺♥️;
Good;
Bahut hi lajawab hai;
Nice;
Trash , an Inauthentic app;
Worst app;
Good;
Good app;
App crashes everytime I attempt to create a thread with 2 or more images. Otherwise very fun app;
I haven't really tried out this social platform app yet but It looks like a rip off of the actual Instagram app. other than the looks itself I give it a 4 star.;
It's a twitter coupie;
I know this app is in its early stages but still it's really vexing how it's showing me irrelevant posts from irrelevant accounts more than posts from accounts that I follow.;
If we delete the app our Instagram account will be deleted or.not;
X (Twitter) is better than Threads;
Well;
Cheap Twitter knock off :(;
@narenda pramr Chunel;
NÃo gote de aplicativo😡😡😡;
Useless;
Not good to learn good thing;
Please add indipendent signup button for non insta users. Waiting to experience it. Love from India.;
Good;
Good;
बेस्ट;
Scrolling is painfully slow. Not sure what the point is, all the content is cross-shared to more stable and established platforms.;
My app just shows empty profiles;
Good;
I have been hacked;
Cheap Copy;
Very nice X app look alike.;
✨ ✨ ✨ ✨ ✨ ✨;
*WARNING FOR INSTAGRAM USERS* If you make an account on threads you will not be able to delete it unless you also delete your instagram account. I am also completely unable to 'deactivate' my threads account even temporarily. + there is an large irremovable badge on my instagram account that advertises my unwanted threads account Do not create a threads account... it is permanent;
Twitter better lmao;
This app is what Twitter should be. Everything about Threads is better than Twitter in every way possible. Also, it's not ran by a nazi.;
Trades failed because it is a separate app and hard to access quickly, and there is no multi-account;
If there is no freedom of expression, this application is useless;
Poor;
Not the Twitter replacement I hoped for. Algorithm is garbage and barely anyone I followed on Twitter has taken up use of Threads, at least not on the timeline I'm shown. I also hate the idea of using a Zuckerberg product;
Perfext;
THIS APP IS WHERE I CAN BE MYSELF AND SHARE NY STORIES WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT JUDGING THIS APP IS MY COMFORT ZONE THANKS FOR MAKING THIS APP;
Meh nothing new;
mudah dan praktis... fitur biasa saja... agak membosankan Update : gak niat buat aplikasi;
Not terrible, I guess?;
A Matrix Platform No freedom of speech Complete copy of X / Twitter;
I don't really see the point for threads you just repost stuff;
Useless;
Add this;
Beautiful;
Pathetic app;
1billion;
Very good app;
Posting new contents are very tedious and tiresome. The time it is taking to load and upload a new content is too much. I understand you've implemented it in a way to keep things decentralised, but kindly check if the upload of new contents can be made a bit more faster.;
It always crack when I start scrolling the screen.;
Excellent.;
Don't even use it;
नया कुछ नही है।;
If y'all could make a feature to have multiple accounts while logged in it would be awesome.;
Very bad;
కలగా పులగం... పాత చింతకాయ పచ్చడే ఈ App... Nothing New and Nothing Unique;
Worst;
Fails to upload a simple thread and this happens all the time even though i clean the cache and restart my device nothing changes;
🦮;
Where is the setting ,and where is the data saver mode . And where is autoplay off setting.I want this options🤬;
0 star rating aap 🗿;
Poosay;
Nice se on this app;
I really want to use it but it simply does not work. I cant see likes, I cant see my own post, I cant see replies, and I tried everything to fix it and twice signaled the problem on the app. Same thing. So uninstalling until it actually work in maybe 6 months or so. Clearly the app was not ready to be lunched.;
Just bad;
Best app;
👍;
Nice 👍;
I'm waiting on Dark Mode for Android as I get migraine pretty quickly without it 🥺 The app experience on launch was more than a little crazy but it is improving fast tbf Importantly there's now a two lane Home Feed . Crazy Lane - Quickly learns what your general interest area is but initially 🤯 . Following Lane - Just the accounts you follow 🤗 It ain't pre-Musk Twitter yet but it definitely has the potential & with a generally more pleasant atmosphere 🙂 for now 🤞😬;
Greatest Social Media App Of All Time !;
Ever since i joined this app i haven't used my insagram it just shows this black instagram icon i don know whats wrong with the app😩;
Blah!;
I don't know for the first time. So I hide the thread shortcut from Instagram. Now I can't unhide the shortcut . Very bad experience for the first time.;
Worst;
Hehheh;
i dont like the badge in my ig profile I can't remove it even though i deactivate my threads.....🤬;
Dispoiting app;
Waste;
Poor made clone of twitter with more data harvesting, far less features and more censorship but Zuck thinks people are going to switch 🤡;
Good app;
Bad app;
The worst thing is that it came first in USA and had to wait likw 2 months in my country in europe;
Nowhere near to Twitter;
It's completely worthless, nothing but Biden trash;
Once you create a Threads profile, the only way to delete it is to also delete your Instagram account, I really like it !!!!;
Eoooo gooid;
Threads Chalana Ha To Systumm Ke Niche Rehna Padegaa 🏆;

Cópia do Twitter meio estranha;
Better';
ليس سيئا و يشبه تويتر الي حدا ما لكن يوجد اخطاء برمجية فيما يتعلق بالإضافة و المتابعة اتمنى إصلاحها فالتحديثات القادمة;
Beautiful UI. But it doesn't show me what I'm interested in. It uses whatever algorithm to show me what the others want to see, but not what I want. That's why it's losing users.;
👍👍👍👍;
💞;
Super;
اسواء تطبيق لان يربط على انستقرام;
Not good;

Mast;
Utterly pointless.;
i hate this app. the ugly badge never leaves my profile no matter how many times i remove it. 😐;
Not good;
Very nice app I love the app so much because you can interact with lots of people world wide. And also you can post contents and get lots of views and comments. You can also gain lots of followers on this app ❤️❤️❤️❤️;
Threads has been an awesome app from the beginning, much better than X.;
Not working;
Stop trying to be twitter/X And stop forcing it;

Idk why it's laggy for me;
☺️☺️;
"Enjoying this better than the ""other"". Need to be able to edit a post. Need #tags\key words and built in translation. Need to see followers and who you're following.";
Just another Instagram app which means it's totally unnecessary;
ALWAYS ERROR! ERROR IN SENDING AN APPEAL, ERROR IN DELETING AN EMAIL ADDRESS, ERROR EVERYWHERE!!! YOU SHOULD FIX YOUR SHTY APP BEFORE YOU COPY OTHER APPS!!!;
Awful;
This is just a worse version of Twitter and Facebook. Pointless.;
Nice;
I am not satisfy with this app.😒;
Copy cat;
Nice app;
Okay, the only thing that I liked about this app now you removed it, I didn't allow people to zoom other profile pic's, and now you allow anyone to zoom the profile pic. The app looks so promessing, it's actually beating Twitter, but to finish it, it need to add the edit button for free, and try to hide the followers and following list without making the whole account private, also we need the #HASHTAGS. That's all for now, Keep up the good work;
Very Good App;
I'm honestly not even sure what the point of this is. Is it like another IG profile? I downloaded it and after scrolling a bit I deleted it.;
Very c bat app for Android;
سر درد;
Oye Remove the batch from Instagram profile.;
Desde hace mucho, no me permite escribir ni ver publicaciones de nadie;
upload time Many of errors show in the app and Many problems and errors are available in this app;
WORST THAN TWITTER;

It doesn't work. Can't post anything or view any interactions. Can you fix it please?;
Good;
One of the best apps in 2023 for connection ideas by text;

Bad idea;

I never did let this app install I want to now how this app self install in my smartphone;

Precisa de melhorias, não recomendo ah bugs no Android.;
I just want to one thing please launch an app when it's working properly not like a version full of bugs;
Cool;
One more waste of time;

Worst app twitter is better than this app;
Poor;
App is decent, but the flaws are that we can't edit our posts/comments, have markdown, and doesn't have DM features, I know it's an early release but I really hope these will be implemented in future updates.;
Nice 👍;

Better than Twitter was.;
Nise app;
App just isn't anything special. It's a very bad version of X. Everything just feels weird when using the app. You can tell others feel the same because it's lost all its steam within a few weeks.😬;
I am currently liking this app because I am from India and I follow a lot of content creators on Instagram but on DMing them They don't reply but at present in this application if you reply to them they also reply 😂😂Followers are crazy, isn't it Babu Bhaiya. 🥱;
We love Facebook;
Good app wish to grow my account ..;
nice;
Worse;
nobody using this app and once you download you cant delete account you need to delete your instagram account this is ridiculous and what the hell is the threads badge on instagram profile 100m im glad for being 100mth person download this. And thats the worst part this badge is unremovable when i remove the badge and refresh the page it appears again i hate you instagram you cant do anything well;
Do love the app and thread daily. I must add its good that they are improving it regularly and listening to requests. We need to use it to improve it 🙂;
Nice;
Twitter extra lite;
A lot of features are missing. App function feels very premature right now. I'll only join when it evolves into a usable application. As of now, it feels like instagram lite which I don't need because I already have a better version of it already, i.e., instagram itself.;
Missu;
It is even doesn't look like a copy Twitter;
Just a copy. American Capitalist Propaganda;

Worst app..;
Good;
Lots of potential here, but it's a bit bare right now in features. I hope you make a separate tab for who you follow.;
This has got to be the most annoying threads ever! No choice is given, based on the assumption you want this thread. Constantly coercing you to join threads by displaying thread numbers on your profile, deceptively making others think you are on threads! Whilst you are not! So devious! I refuse to download the app! You can't even opt out! No delete! No cancellation. There are no options. So no download!;
Nice work this app;
Loss. App;
Happy new threads net/@praison p75;
Where Dark Theme? WHERE???;
Great 👍;
Thyanks sir Use for app verry nice;
Not even touching twitter not by a long shot;
Work easy;

This app intersting;
Boring af;
Worst app ever... Everything is copied..!;
Impuslively created app;
Like following back;
Bad experience;
This is basically a clone of Twitter Andrew Tate was right. THREADS stinks Booo I prefer Twitter;
Much better at keeping violent Republicans & other American Traitors & Felons from spreading poison. Still adding features.;
Very wrost app and I have to delete my thread account but my Instagram I'd delete, please update as soon as...;
😁;
Can't wait for needed improvement. It's missing the feature to easily switch between accounts so I can manage my personal and my brand accounts more easily.;
Very important app sabhi log isko jyada se jyada share Karo aor download karo thanks for watching...🚩🚩🥰🇮🇳;
Needs lots of improvements app has good caliber.;
Forget Twitter;
X for the win;
Twitter>>>>>;
Its good;

I like this so much better than Twitx. Less hate and racism. But video posts stop playing once unmuted. Hope they fix that soon.;
Nice 👍;

Looks better than elons X;
I change my instagraam password and now I am unable to access my account due to password change and the worst thing is I didn't find entering password option could you pls fix this issue ASAP.Thak you looking for a quick response;
Es me inbox q nhi Diya sir apne .....?;
Literally nothing works, I can see threads but no replies and when I try to post a reply I get an error;
Cooler than Twitter and FB;
It won't connect to my Instagram.;
Poor;
Search is abysmal,;
This is good;
Underwhelming with a lack of draw to come back to the app. Threads feels unfinished and over a month later, there has hardly been any further updates. Poor execution.;
It ok And i love d app Thnx;
You should update it the way that we can contact people private;
Very helpful And good;

Very nice pic;
Why you collected lots of sensitive data such as our biometric?;
peniru itu harusnya lebih bagus, kok ini masih bagusan twitter;
Got boring, stale and lifeless pretty fast. Yet still no basic features were updated after a couple of months. Pointless app and it's pointless hype, all for nothing.;
Awesome 👍;
Good;
If you sign up for this than your signing up for censorship. If I could I would give this negative 5 stars;
Very good;
So beautiful apps 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓;
No Instagram 👎 thread look wow;
Htt bahanchd 📢;
Great app, but biggest issues 20% people face that, once time you hide threads budge on your Instagram account never back un hide so please fix this and un hide option in Instagram or threads app thank you. I Hope you, fix this problem.;

More data mining, and it's an attempt to infect a better platform (the fediverse) with Facebook\instagram\meta's corrupt management practices.;
Doesn't work with a lot of bugs;
Worst;

Too bored and no opinion to make this apps being like twitter (X);

Nothing new, nothing exciting other than a lift out of existing app. Didnt see a creativity here. i was happily installed the app but dissapointment of the app made me to uninstall it. sorry.;

It's difficult to understand;
Best app ever❤;
Please update more indian translate language..;

Twitter is always best....;
I call this app to brother of Twitter this app has no own identity To build this app instagram wasted time money and everything because in that time, money or everything I can use to build a product which is different from the other Very disappointed 😞;
Super;
Perfect.;
i keep removing my threads ID on my insta profile and it is still coming back??!!?;
Follow करो 😍🤔😗😘;
Bekar h ......ye App bs extra time barbad krne ke liye banaya gya h ......phli baat toh ye instagram se bahar nhi aa pa rha hu ....mnata hu Naya cheez h but esko samjte- samjte ....kb meri jindagi ke lawde lg jayenge ....mujhe samj nhi aayega ....toh Maine bs download Kiya tha ki rating de sakun .;
good app;
New;
It's very nicc and cool app.;
Ok;
Sucks;
Nice 🙂🙂👍👍;
garbage 👌;
Was working fine for like the first two days after launch. Then my likes, my profile, any comments just refused to load and just said try again. Have uninstalled it and installed it again every now and then till this day and its still same problem. Raised a ticket to dev, dont think it was followed up at all.;
Twitter (X) Is a lot better and has more satisfying ui and use then threads to be honest;
Best app;
It's fine;
Now that updates have happened I up my review to 5 stars;
Twitter knock-off;
We should be able to delete out threads accounts without having to delete our Indtagram accounts in the process.;
Everyone is yet to begin;
It's good;
Nice;
🤞;
worthless idk why you thought about making this;
Useless all;
This is very good app;
Its good 👍;
I don't like this much I suggest don t download bcuz this app is waste of time;
Not bad;
I wish I would have never downloaded this;
Good;
Interesting app, but I bummed that I need to create an Instagram account to be able to use it, I would add the fifth star if that changes.;
Very nice;
Not good;
It doesn't even deserve one star. So annoying you can't even delete your account after opening it. And the number of when you joined threads always pops up on you ig account so annoying. I don't see any use of this app;
Can join;
Rostock;
Knock knock knock, are you alive?;
Video like;
Very nice;
Osm app;
Unoriginal;
1mmm;
This app doesn't turn with my tablet or phone, why? Where is update?;
Good;
Terrible app. Full of woke people that don't want to be able to share ideas unless it's their own. Don't bother unless you're part of that mob.;
I can't even scroll normally or share posts but it has good contents;
Very good app;
Suck algorithm.;
"It all started well but I now have a problem that I can't post or reply to threads (only react with ""likes"") nor even see comments underneath someone's initial thread. I've deleted the cache, reinstalled the app, checked server, checked WiFi speed, no VPN... It's a problem with the app. Please fix it.";
Nice apps;
Thip app was interested because some news are pending;
Threads,an Instagram..;
I WANT TO DELETE MY ACCOUNT!!!;
the algoritm just work for users who's got a lot of followers in IG so they get more followers in here. the app needs hashtag too;
Bad application, I can't see my Threads or replies or other threads, it's a baddest application I ever used 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡;
Nice app;
It doesn't work.;
❤;
Half baked, under-designed. This is what happens when you release an app to a huge audience with no basic functionality.;
Good 👍😊;
Best among all;
Nice to meet you app;
This apps needs more time to be as big as IG and it is clearly not for a while;
I love this app everything is good and is just like twitter no videos if you want to watch you search there should be a place to watch videos like Facebook Instagram and the rest thread lite is coming soon anyways thanks to mark Zuckerberg battling with Elon musk;
Just another twitter, nothing much;
Baler app;
They had a following and for you tab that I never seen again after using it 2x;
Please do give a music option for videos while posting!! 💪💪♥️ Rest all gud and further update we wana see!;

Very glitchy. Features don't work consistently. There doesn't seem to be much effort to fix the constant issues.;
Nice;
Its very bad app this app is very nonsense;
Because that's from Instagram I love Instagram;
Copy paste;
Worst app;
Nice 🤗♥️✨;
Bugged at even basic functionality;
This is my fav app;
Definitely a fun experience so far. I'd give it a 4 for now since it still needs some essential features. Hopefully, new features roll out faster.;
No usecase;
Only usable if you're one of those stupid woke leftist socialist nazis. If you're Christian and sane then don't bother.;
Good;
Frustrating tablet UI;
I can't download it;
Worst app ever launched;
The app is awesome;
As best for us;
Complete waste of time;
Nowhere near as polished/refined as Twitter (X). Doesn't offer the same experience. I used it for a week and uninstalled.;
Very immature product. Not worth switching to as of August '23 in my opinion.;
Lol, maybe try better when you copy another app next time, lol;
Bad;
Twitter is better threads is cheap copy of it 😂😂;
A few suggestions: 1. Dark mode option. Please. 2. Easy switch between accounts instead of required to log out first. 3. Can change username even if linked to Instagram.;
Really good app. Would have earned five stars if they had a messaging feature like in Instagram;
you better make this app better than Twitter or X cause I'm sick of Elon musk's update;
Nice;
Baaad;
flopped harder than pepe at arsenal;
Censorship;
Rated 5* when it came out, i thought it would end Twitter's monopoly but Threads app now became a joke.😂😂;
Perfect;
I love this app 😍😍;
Awful app, don't recommend.;
Walmart discount version of twitter;
Instagram without photos! That's all!;
🦎;
Really need to work on large screen support.;
I know this is a Zuckerberg app but can we PLEASE have a feed in chronological order!!!!!!;
Nice;
"My Instagram account is aliaakhaliid, the problem I can't remove the thread number from my profile, ""Hide Badge"" choice doesn't work, fix this problem please";
It's so excited platform to express views or thinking.;
Shivam purvaiya;
Better if this has Edit button to edit posts. 😅;
It's lacking but decent. I'd love to make this a permanent alternative to X but until there's a search function it's not used as much as I'd like to.;
I download this app and join it with my Instagram and the next I found that my Instagram is hacked and it was very troubled situation for me so for me it was a very bad experience with this app it should be more aware about the privacy;
I tried to log İn but it gives me error, not to proceeding next after entering password. It shows some message.;
Nice app;
Good;
I Thought it was a Good interface...I liked how it gives you a Number for your Account I.D. Easy back and Forth with Instagram also 👌 Nice Launch to the Team at Threads...Now only if you could get me back all of my old Instagram Accounts YOU Would be Amazing 👏 😀 😉;

Worst app .... Befaaltu ka app bnaya jisne b banaya ....don't install it ....discard the app;
Disappointing;
the app is great but doesn't work properly;
"In the first week of launch, all the old people were talking about how this would ""destroy Twitter/X"" but here we are now, a dead socmed platform. None of my favorite threaders post anymore. It was good while it lasted ig.";
Ghatiya app nothing new;
Very bad app;
I have been trying to make changes for you to Make cas;
It could be better. Need to add those who doesn't want instagram!;
Lol fukbuk 😂😂😂 chor, x re copy kore lav nai;
"When you try to look through any followed account's profile, the application shows ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try again"". That stinks.";
Nice app;
N I, X a red raw We,;
Its good and all the only problem I have ran into is I cant switch profiles easily. I'd have to log out then log into my other acc then do it again.;
Good;
Copy cat zuck;
Bad.;
It's very nice;
Well i can clearly say twitter is better;
🤗🤗🤗🤗🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🤗🤗🤗🤗🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳❤️❤️🤗🤗🇮🇳🤗🤗🇮🇳🤗🤗💐💐💐🤗🤗;
wellcome to @threads//2023//Nice=APP;
I already installed the app after its launch, but a few days ago, it said something went wrong when I tried to post. Please fix this ASAP so I can use my Threads account again.;
A bad app;
Very nice man;
Gandh jese app hain;
Very very Bad I think that this app is just consuming space in Playstore's storage Trust me why do you have to have multiple apps that does the same thing. Trust me guys just don't increase its Downloads Count!!;
Dude wanna be Twitter so bad 🤣;
twitter walmart edition;
Good 👍;
Always hangs , couldn't use it ,worst ..;
Now, instagram have released Threads, this was decided a long ago, because we can't post like this on instagram, so they decided to build this app after a long time that after it they will get attention 😀;
💙;
Nice app 👍;
It is launched in fight with X (Twitter);
Nice;
Sahi hai;
I am giving only one star because there is no separate tab For the threads of people whom i follow, All threads like old, new are all in same tab. Those p people i don't follow but their threads are on my timeline, totally rubbish;
Please support brother;
It's okay right now. The app needs some basic features. There is no algorithm for me to reach anyone. No communities to find. I think those two are very important. Being able to reach and find various communities that you take part in. Yeah, you can pull followers from instagram, but that's not completely efficient. They MIGHT be active.;
Super;
It's amazing😍👍;
Super;

Dumb;
Change threads logo please..... Stay in black & white color for logo but make different logo for threads..............;
good 👍😊;
👍;
super 👍;
Great platform! But it lacks some features like hashtags, trending, homefeed customisation, etc. I would like to request Meta to consider these and update the application. Thanks.;
Wooo;
Wow dis app verry nice 👍;
Peaceful place to share your views;
TWITTER 🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦🐦;
This is just cheap version of Twitter;
It's literally Twitter but a bit better;
Lekin Instagram ki followers low ho rahi hai;
Very fantastic;
Just more Garbage that doesn't work, how many years has Facebook been screwed up and never fixed right.;
Another scam to collect Data. The only one did a good job is the ui designer.;
Can't see the replies, doesn't load old threads;
Super sir app;
Mmm.;
"Can't even post there. ""your thread failed to upload"", and that's through all the updates. What's even the point of this mockery of an app";
REAALLLY GRRRREAT;
Really fail;
I like the threads, easy, fun but needs more participation;
Good;
Is there any purpose with this app besides being like Twitter?;
Yeah good.;
Khul bhari app;
La aplicación nunca me abrió 😹😹😹;

This app really need to work with hashtag audience, i need specific followers;
Its very amazing performance 💯💯❤️❤️;
Basically ripped off tumblr 😂😂😂;
Pls let me in to threads and instagram I was just joking about my age I will never disobey your terms and policy let me back to my old account;
why isn't this app available in landscape mode for tablets?;
💔💔;
Twitter is better than this just a bad copy of Twitter 🤮🤮🤮🤮;
Twitter ke Abba aa gye;
Pls let us delete threads account without deleting insta account please 😩🥺🙏;
Really really like Twitter. This is really a bad copy. Not authentic. Not a new idea. Threads is a model of anti free speech twitter.;
Very bad Thread application Not working properly app;
These app can hack your account my account also hacked.;
Iju;
App is awesome i am in love with it, But, Users post something by expressing anything in words, And as a human there will be some mistakes while writing, So, Thread, Requesting u to provide edit option after posting a post in thread, Which can help thread users to correct their only mistake, A word or a letter, Rather than deleting complete post and rewriting again. Update this in ur platform, As soon as possible, Lots of love to entire thread. And i am waiting for lovely update from threads.;
Very bad app.. I'm not satisfied to use this..😏 then I deleted this thread app my Instagram account is deactivated..😏 is a cheating to me.. guy you all use X not this..😏;
The home feed is full of brands trying to be hip and relatable that I don't even follow. This kind of shallowness is unbearable.;
Nice App Good Luck App Creators Good Job;
Nice App;
Similar Twitter but it's better.;
Please provide you massage chat;
Instagraam support 🙏;
I love it;
Average;
Donkey doodoo;
Found that Iam unable to delete threads account until I delete my insta account;
Add photo save option;
Good;
Don't use this app, you can not delete your account, once you create.;
While I do think the app has some potential, there are several problems. Some of them include the lack of photo filters when you upload photos, the inability to delete your Threads account without your Instagram account, the inability to use more than one account, and the app crashing several times when I log out, leading myself to delete data and cache rather frequently. I wish this app wasn't released prematurely and that Instagram gives more time to develop Threads as a more stable app.;
"I literally can't do anything on the app other than like other people's threads. As for adding my own, search or my activity I can't see or do anything - it keeps saying ""Sorry something went wrong. Try again"" and it's been that way for over a month now.";
Very very good 👍😊;
Bakwash;
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳;
Next Twitter.;
Nice;
I removed my badge number on my IG profile and I can't figure out how to put it back;
I do like it, but not better then Instagram;

You have to have an Instagram account,if not don't waist your time downloading it.;

Not impressed 😁;
Bad experience;
Average app;
I love it;
Garbage 🗑 app;
Beautiful;
It needs more features and it does have the potential to be a Twitter killer, but it's too bland at the moment. I hope they make more updates in the near future so they can attract more people from the dead blue bird.;
I like ❤️;
This is amazing 👍👍;
Boring. They obviously had to release this after what Elon did to twitter, but it's just more of the same junk.;
nothing interesting;
Edit: I can save images! 5 stars! i can't save images. So why would even want to use this compared to Twitter;
Worst App ever, need alots of changes, it seems like a 3rd class copy.;
It okay;
Best app;
It's bad;
I want you to verified my account;
Better than twitter;
Good for public;
Lame;
Zucked;
Threads is best👌👌;
Tiene todo lo malo de Twitter y lo bueno lo censura, zzz;
Just join a real federated instance not this half baked attempt by one of the worst companies in tech. Mastodon isn't hard to figure out at all. I gave it one star back bc the refresh animation is cool;
Twitter fake;

It would be 5 stars but I'm currently having an issue posting with photos.;
One of the worst app in world. They tried to copy twitter, but were humiliated badly.;
Trust full;
Copymark;
Dead app;
The app is a safe space for me to post and the reply and community is mostly friendly and not so toxic, I hope they will improve this app, as this is having more potential. I've been mostly use this for news and nice posts so it's okay.;
nice;

Very good;

Thanks for prompting me from Instagram. You deserve this 1 Star;
As I am trying to follow new pages, it always showing like we restrict our community and please try again later. Fed up with this app. Please update.;
Okay 👍;
Too good like twitter;

"I want to deactivate profile and it just says ""failed to deactivate profile""";

It's fast, usable and there's great content. And unlike Twitter/X it doesn't arbitrarily slow down links to things the owner doesn't like.;

Great app At first glance tons of room for improvement such as an edit thread button, also spaces and dms. The look is more like ig not Twitter like. Verification is needed for anyone who chooses to be . That could be a paid service . Keep the disinformation at a minimum . And #hashtags;
Terrible app. Twitter is superior. Anything created or owned by cuckerberg should not be used.;
😎;
how can I remove the bage number of my insta account???!!!!!;

I can't use it. It simply doesn't work. I doesn't matter how many times I install and uninstall the app. It just won't let me do anything but see the main feed. The rest is all a huge glitch! 😅;
Good so far, but if Meta is going to own the 3 major social media, can we have one with NSFW content being allowed?;
Very basic;

uninstalling until someone tells me there's an option to split newsfeed between people i follow and complete randos. tired of my feed being nothing but random celebs and checkmarks no matter how many of them i block or hide. i just want to see the people i follow. dropped a ball opening with that, bad first impression, this could have been something great (and it still could be, just give me the choice to remove the randoms from my feed gd);

Nice UI but feels like I'm using a different algorithm everyday;
Literally the worst. Thinking that Zuckerberg could be fresh and innovative to counter Twitter/X was a pipeline dream. Not worth the time or effort for the crashing and data it steals.;
🖤;
Pretty good alternative to x, not all the way there yet but seems to be on the right track.;
😫😩;
Not better than Twitter;

I really like this app and i dont know why;
Good;
I do not want Instagram;

Very nice thank you so much;
Cool start but really needs the ability to create lists.;
Unable to post anything;
Boring;
Threads is follo;
Typically the copy of X;
Did we even need another messaging app?Facelook insta twatter twuth and now THREADS? FMeBackwards howmany platforms do we need to tell someone else something! THREADS sounds like it's a haberdashery. What a 🔔 end you are Zuckertwerb!;
😵‍💫 West;
This app stole rights from the Twitter app;
I really want the CEO of meta to kindly separate threads from Instagram because threads is really not good,such a slow type app nothing much to explore and I can't even delete it because my Instagram account is connected to it. Meta please help;
Tweeter Copy Paste!;
Still better than your X.;
The Best;
Has potential, very bare bones. I hope this doesn't get fully abandoned and they actually keep working on and building it up. I hate Twitter or X whatever tf and threads is so close to being the best next best thing to itm Zucchini pls work that lizard magic.;
Ok;
Good;
A bad copy of Twitter or X that's a bad copy of itself;
Threads is so Cool 😎 but I wish it had a dark mode;
What was meant to be Meta's version of Twitter, seriously seriously lacks. Seeing threads from people you don't follow? Seeing threads posted days ago as if they're new? That's what Instagram is, why use the time and money for something not really new or far relevant to its main competitor which is Twitter (X);
Copy of Twitter;

Yo, why profile being public can't be switched back to private?? Everytime i am trying to do so it is saying sorry we have encountered some problem..? Have been trying since 2 days.. and now if I am trying to delete my threads, it is saying to delete my instagram as well.. will you fix it or what? Will u do something or not?? I am writing for the second time reiterating the same. Now it is becoming irritating that I can't change my profile to private.. it is seriously threat to privacy.;
So nice app;
Twitter;
1 star for the love of Elon Musk;
Supper;
Installing this app isn't a good idea if you concern about privacy ⚠️;

Find ways to delete thread profile without having to deleting instagram account asap! worst app ever;
Very nice;
That's absolutely amazing 🤩;
Basically a news app, especially when people of your interests use Instagram and not threads. Just use Twitter instead!!!;
Kkok;
Not interesting for use 😕;
Good 👍;
okay 👍;
Waste app. Uninstalled it as it sucks.;
It works for me used daily!;
It's just not good enough;
3rd class app is this;
Never experienced such a nice social media app. Hope it stays nice!;
Requires and Instagram account, but you can't sign up, you need to also install Instagram.. not sure this is anymore than the Instagram app with slight rebranding. What the Zuck man? Where the Zuck is the fediverse?;
It's just a copy of X, not much to do on it and don't see the point of copying X without adding any value.;
Not as aspected;
Zuckerberg sucks;
Want some more features;
"""Not available in your area"" THEN DON'T GIVE ME THE OPTION TO INSTALL IT";
Pathetic act by Zuck 😤;
Just get the web version to start asap;
It's so better than the twitter oo! Im sory the X 😒😒😒😑😑😑;
Images/videos are not maxed out edge to edge like in Instagram. I don't want to open the media to look at it.;
Please add this feature to readd the threads id to Instagram bio...;
You can't do anything here;
Very good!! Better than x🤮❣️;
Good;
🤡Nice move Zuckerberg;
Bakwass;
I really don't see the point in this app. Also, I really don't like how you can't delete your Threads account without deleting your Instagram.. edit: Can't get rid of the threads button. It's so dumb. I don't use it.;
What's the point of this app exactly? Trying to make a new Twitter? Why not just integrate it to the already existing insta app?;
Was working great at first but suddenly decided that there was activity on an unknown device and has blocked access. It was only being used on one device. Tried uninstalling, power cycle, reinstall but no luck there. It is now uninstalled and will stay that way until there is a desktop version to try.;
Nice try;
ajib app hai Twitter ka soutela bhai hai ye app;
This app suck and is a poor attempt a Twitter now known as X clone that is nothing like X at all;
this is very bad at all interested in buying this for you;
Sandeep Paliwal;
Very bad;
The overall experience of the app is good but the thing is I cannot change my bio since the very launch of this app. I have reported this bug 3 times through app but still nothing has been done so far. I hope developers will resolve this asap.;
Has to go Desktop before I will use it.;
Mark is a genius his projects are highly reviewed before going live. I enjoy using his works Thread is such an amazing app;
🗑️🚮;
my love free 🆓. cutie 🥰;
What a joke of an app. It's just a tunnel of lies and politics. It's nasty! X is way better!;
Cópia não comédia;
Not interested nothing is special this app😒;
Not Bad at all Helps with my Music posts sometimes;
I love threads. Even though people say it's a Twitter copy, it's a great app. It just dropped, but it's amazing. Imagine after some improvements, I believe it'll definitely beat Twitter or X.;
Hi This app is good app . Me not talk not good This is good App but more updates. New Update point ( video upload apsan, video create,and more . Thank you;
It's tied to Instagram... Uninstalled. I was hesitant anyway because of Meta. Lots of false positive AI generated reviews. Note: Im not a fan of Twitter.;
The most important feature of social networks is that it does not have the ability to put hashtags. There is no possibility of correct arrangement of words and sentences in Persian writing, and words, sentences and symbols are inserted in different places. There is no way to know which followers are following us unless we check manually. It does not have the ability to tell a story. Direct message is not possible. Many settings are related to Instagram settings, which causes problems for this us;
Bekar app hai time waste;
So bad why Bad, why can't I just watch who I follow, why explore and random?;
Love it everyone should try it;
Ronilocanquenala;
Please@100+;
Uploading takes forever!!!!;
Needs a dark mode;
It just doesn't do enough.;
I love this app ❤️😍;
Just a janky, stale experience;
so you can only use this app if you're a Instagram user?;
Good;
Buggy app! i am not able to post anything there;
Please a option of chatting like in instagram but some next level chats and other thing. It would enhance the using of people;
As it's not there for PC and no new innovations;
Nice aap I'm happy with 😊;
Nice;
"Better it has ""sync thing"" in the next update. What are posted on instagram, it automatically sync into thread.";
Nice;
Terima Kasih atas bantuan dan pertolongannya 🙏;
No. I don't need to see random people threads on my homepage, I just want to see people I follow, thanks.;
same as insta...no innovative...what's new in it...all is about Facebook algorithm...just making a cult of...& locked with Instagram...ho ho..;

I really appreciate apps like this where you don't have to show much in order to share your ideas, views, opinions, etc.;

Sooo pointless..;
It's good app i like to do editing program in the app;
Bad clone of Twitter! 👎;
What new innovation is it? It could be better if you try to challenge twitter with open source platform to revolutionize free speech. But this just seems like a new way to collecting the data and earning sales revenue. I order to delete thread profile, have to delete insta account as well. What a pathetic idea. Hope some one find the instagram replacement. So, I can delete both.;
Phenomenal 🙌🏾;
If after singing in I am by default start following then why I can't get followers by default. It's an Instagram app so if I am following someone and that person is also following me on Instagram then why it doesn't happen in Threads by default because we have already approved each other in one app then what's the point of doing all that again. While copying X (Twitter) Meta has created mess and the most funny thing is you can't even delete this mess.;
Nice;
it is possible to share insta reels to threads right away?;
Nice;
I am experiencing a frustrating bug with this app and I hope the developers can fix it soon. The bug occurs when I try to open multiple thread links from another app. The first link opens fine, but the second link does not load properly. It shows the content of the first link instead of the second one. The only way to open the second link is to close the app completely and then click on it (the link) again. This is very inconvenient and annoying. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible.;
:DD;
Poor 8dea;
There is no way to signup for this app. It is 100% dependent on an Instagram account. Sad.;
Best apps;
Just because;
👌;
Very Good appp;
Afterall its an Instagram app, lacks important personalities as competition and need much improvement in feed as it resembles very much photographs of models or memes;

The people are great, a lot of good discussions, but the app is getting buggier by the day, posting errors galore, and can't copy the failed posts to repost, have to type the whole thing out again... And where is the promised desk top version? The website just shows the same thing it's shown since day one... Weak sauce, Zuckerberg... Weak sauce.;
It's really clunky to use. Really difficult to follow a thread. 🙄;

pls add hashtag and trends;

UI is great I wish you have this kind of UI on WhatsApp and fb too but excuse me can you please rather then making a different app put all threads features on Instagram somewhere. 2 different features in one app will be better. I don't need this app.;
this is excellent app;
Waste of time app;
Pointless;
Absolutely a fail! Sorry back to x!;

As I said it had a solid start but if the updates can't come sooner than later than I don't see this app lasting at all anymore, but hope they come soon enough :(;

Good app the only thing it's missing is analytics and views thank you;
Nice and clean app. I hope they don't ruin it;
I will not use this app until I can have a separate account from my IG account. A world of us would prefer to not have everything linked together.;
I ended up deleting this app because I couldn't find much use for it & it takes up too much space for basically being Twitter but with the same people I have on Instagram. I regrettably sent my friends list with a request to join this app only to realize Instagram is just easier. An attempt was made though.;
Very very interesting app 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌;

Missing a lot of basic features;

Why scheduling post system not inbuilt in threads?;
BLUF - to delete threads you have to delete instagram! They're collecting a massive amount of data on you too. Remember, META is an ADVERTISING COMPANY with a disgusting POLITICAL AGENDA, not a social media company only people giving this garbage positive reviews are employees. Another app by a greedy anti-american woke company that needs to disappear. Mark Zuckerberg, the democrat puppet, needs to fade away back to the slime he was bred from. We don't need your censorship on another platform!!;
Good;
Don't know how to use it;
Good app;
I like the concept of Threads. It's basically Twitter without the craziness that has taken over that app. I also like that it is attached to your Instagram account. However, the lack of hashtags makes it very hard to find communities and topics to follow. Fix that, and the app should go far.;

its okay, hard to explore new content, there is no explore page yet. hard to find trending content/current content. the app is very bare bones at the moment but it does what it needs to. i would like to see trending content/ news content, and a way to explore new content without scrolling past new posts from accounts i currently follow on the home page;

I downloaded the Threads app with high hopes, but my experience has been quite disappointing. The app's lack of optimization is immediately noticeable – it feels sluggish and unresponsive. What's even worse is that the app crashes multiple times, making it incredibly frustrating to use. It's evident that the app contains numerous bugs and errors, which further hampers its usability. I really wanted to like Threads, but its current state leaves much to be desired. I hope the developers address th;

The more I follow the less I see credible information from trusted sources. When I do finally see a credible post it's already 16hrs -2days old. The app as it is creates a vacuum of slow info & misinformation if you are not very careful picking who to follow. Information is washed out the more you follow which has discouraged me from following any more accts & now I'll be looking to unfollow as a way to weed out anything that prevents me from seeing up to date credible information.;

A feable copy of Twitter but less interesting and with fewer features. Like with all Meta products the algorithm is terrible, so you don't see a timeline of interesting or relevant threads.

Zuck proves again he got lucky with Facebook which also is lackluster compared to social media apps these days.

I miss the old Twitter so much but this design is much more pleasing. Reminds me of when apps weren't trying to all be the same and instead using their own appeal to draw new users. The aesthetic is more pleasing than twitters though, good design and good improvement. The only thing I wish is that you could message each other. It would be great to link Instagram messages to threads and have them sync.;
Cheap app.....;
This app is instant, bring the option of BS chat, more and more people will start using it.;
Please disable video auto play. Add hastags to search. Add lists.;

"So far the ""Threads"" app is giving alot vibe. But some features need to be included to make it more engaging for users worldwide. For example a Chat section, where two people can discuss & also maybe group chats, that is like users get to create group chats for people to join based on their interests & thereby expanding their threads community even more. Also the app is really great, so it would be very appreciated if meta can add these features i put down here.";
Nice app;
Worst Copy paste of twitter;
Threads app;
We loved 😍 ❤️ ♥️ more ever forever ❤️ ♥️ 💙 💜..;
Cesspit like Twitter.;

Best app after Twitter;

Not so funny... The twitter (X) is cooler🤷🏻‍♀️;
I unexpected and very so much;
trash;
Wrost app ever. Plz remove threats id from our instagram⛔⛔⛔;
Nice app;
Impossible to use with this UI;
Worst;
It's a copy of Twitter;
Good 👍 device new app;
Okay nice social media;
Nice;
Nice;
good;
👎;
Ok so after a while of occasionally popping in the app, literally all you see are company run accounts posting promotions. No humans actually use this app.;
"The app keeps saying ""Sorry. Something went wrong"" when I'm trying to read the feed, to see threads in profile, on my page, when I'm trying to post comment or my post. Absolutely useless!";
its alright;
Please bring in status viewer. Bring in reel as in Instagram. Grateful!!!;
X is better;
My badge remove;
Sound selection not option so handle single movement;
Can't see anything, app is broken.;
Not impressed. No info on how to use that I could see. So not user friendly in my opinion. Thanks, but no thanks! I'll stick with what works, Instagram and Facebook. Deleted Threads until it gets it's act together. The logo says it all really, one big mess!;
Awesome;
Trash app;
Twitter better;
Worst;
Are bhai kam se kam badge ka option to dal de yrrr insta pe;
Threads is not comfort in a x because threads have more a corruption opponent likes and no any save post and bookmarks and main thing so much biggest of in file 70 mb;
Good;
ARAYN kaumr💯;
very very bad;
Total garbage, pathetic excuse, another sad attempt by the weenies at Meta;
Not like;
Please return back the batch id on instagram account which removed by mistake.. Please Fix this.;

New and interesting ❤️;
So bad app;
My posts are disappearing! 🤔 No improvement to the app just getting worst.;
Threads is being a good app that makes me trend and Gain follower's Back to back I'm rating 5 star's;
Ameerahmad;
dude this app is a bad cheap copy of twitter lmao??;
Copy;
Great app to make quick public posts. Followers can make posts that appear under your so you get a nice threaded timeline posting.;
Search function for stocks needs to be reimagined;
Good;

Bekar app hai guy's;
I just thout it would be nice to see someone fail so 1 star it is;
Very good;
"deleted my profile, and the badge still shows up on Instagram even after I select ""remove badge"" 🚮";
Good;
Best app 🥰;
A positive blogging space that rivals and even bests Twitter (X). A developing app with plenty of opportunity, brimming with good vibes and fun. RIP Twitter.;
Wow 😲 nice to ap;
Very good 👍 aap;
Manti ghosh;
Nice 👍;
Nope. Only Instagram;
Op;
Use twitter;
Its gud for sharing our personal exp nd all ..;
My Single Love Philippines World I'm Good Yooo;
Very bad app;

I've been posting for months: no human interaction. It's like talking in the void of Internet.;
Naic;
Meh;
"I'll give this a 3 for now, it could really use something ""wow"" to draw more people feom the X man!";
Full time waste app Isse bache or apni study pr dhiyaan De aane wali naslo ko kharab krne wale app hai ye;
Good application;
What was the point of creating this app;
Not interested app very poor 💯💯💯🙄😒;
Good;
Rushed clone of Twitter X with bare-bones features. What's the advantage? Heavy moderation to match the whims of the Meta CEO?;
app developer is very poor in our work;
Threads¿🤔 X 🗿🗿🗿;
Tise is very usfullii Bhut acha hai ye ✨❤️ Love it ..Threads ✨🎯;
Thousands of messages from people I don't know, on subjects I don't care about.;
Worst app ever I used;
Nice;
L app;
Not available in my area, UK, neither in Spain. So... Meh;
trash;
Flop. Delete this app and resolve your issues on Instagram. Especially the low reach on Instagram that people are experiencing.;
It's robbed from Elon Musk 😡;
Its look like twitter but doesn't match twitter level. I hope this app very but this app felt my expectation ..;
My Ccrriisstine account was on my old phone but switxhed phone and is shows my profile and about but not the rest of the profile;
Good..;
trash af;
Serves no purpose, just seems like another way to push ads on users for revenue. Pretty much does the same thing as FB and Instagram. Needs recreating with it's own identity.;
Good;
The app cause issues for IG app and also effects my other app so I deleted it and my problem got fix ,it was closing my instagram when I did try to open my app ig it was effects my instagram app.;
Perfect thanks so much for your coustom and hard work looking after my phone apps and development keep up the good work you do xXx;
Please.... landscape tablet UI support....;
Plz unhide my badge in Instagram;
Nice 20Milion Follow;
Exactly like instagram.. 'cringe';
This is a good app;
good;
Nais app;
Amazing 😍❤️;
😞;
Ew;
Honestly it's a good app to use. I was very conscious to download it👍👍;
👍;
Propaganda lies and sin. Overdoing it on the animals more than people, I think it's a people internet, not an animal internet. tired of seeing more animals And anthropomorphic. It's pitiful. it's not entertaining. Cute, is become boring and guess what? The animal shelters are filling up because people are disappointed and their pets. .;
its like if twitter was made by disney. the vibes were good for maybe one whole hour of release. does anyone even use this anymore lmfao;
Nice wark;
Bando app;
Pointless;
So nice app;
X is best;
Wassip;
Love it;
Good Experience;
Ssssuper;
Exlent service;
Remember that I would like to see you in a new place where I can see you in my own life and I was al Gas prices have fallen in the past few years because the economy has grown to about a quarter 5million and a good friend and I was al gore in the future of a Republican house in;
No camment;
Please add dark mode option to this app. There should be a dark mood option in the second update.👍;
Super;
Nice;
Nice app;
don't want it on a phone, need it on PC;
Good 👍;
Nothing special in it ...such a useless app.;
Awesome 👍;
Bad appa ever. I can't upload my new profile after update to the new version. The. I can't delete this acc coz I don't want to loose my ig acc.. sucks!!!;
ll__king__ganuu__03;

Please don't show up in my Instagram feed.;

Accha hain;
𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝, 𝐧 𝐥𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦 𝐚𝐩𝐩;
Average;
Its very good 😊;
Love this app thanks;
Twitter without the topics, the hashtags and private messaging. Nothing to keep me engaged. Plus, I'm seeing posts in my timeline from users I don't follow. Not even Instagram does that. Some of these users, I've never even heard of. Please add more to this app;
The app is nothing like x I think you guys need to better its more like a off brand version of it like do better;
Useless;
I love this app, as it has way fewer spam bots than most, and a great community. BUT IT'S SO BUGGY, I CANT UPLOAD PHOTOS half the time it says failed to upload, crashes constantly, and is just absolutely too buggy. Needs a lot more features and then it will be a great app. Not being able to post just randomly makes the app nearly unusable.;
love you instag ❤️❤️;
Very Nice , but need some updates to use easy;
It super;
Good;
useful;
Nc;
Copy past from Twitter, very bad app from mark;
Better, more fun, healthier, and more informative than TikTok. I can dig it.;
Good;
Not user friendly;
not perfect but better;
Very nice app;
It's good just for scrolling can't upload can't post anything...;
Eversince creating this profile, there have been attempts to hack my other Social profiles. Literally unsafe app.;
Amazing;
Very disturbed app 😔;
Lol tried to fight head-on with Twitter. Now whose head is broken 😂;
Mast;
Good App;
my account got hacked when i used it this apps;
A complete rip off of Twitter but with the Meta overlords' moderation and false news promotion.;
No la usaría más.;
Very good;
Great I love it🤞🏾🥰💕;
Super;
i love the community of threads as people are spreading more and more positivity;
Dear Developers Thread app is a very cute app. But if you keep it separate from Instagram, it can be an even better app.My point is that Thread and Instagram are two separate apps. They should be different. Thanks;
Excellent alternative to that right-wing cesspool known as Twitter.;
LUCKY;
Everyone has the right to express their political and economic opinions. However, it is important to remember that sharing pictures of individuals who are against Islam may not be respectful or productive. We have to give a shut-up call to control these anti-Islamic activities. But when I gave a shut-up call, the thread removed my account. #TLP #لبیک لبیک یا رسول اللہ ﷺ;
Instagram hi sahi hai je to kuch jane kesa sada aap hai kuch samajh nahi aata isme to😠😠😠😠😠;
Good;
Fake app.. installed it and instantly deleted this poor copy of twitter;
I can't enable dark mode on threads pls fix that;
The App size is Massive can it go a little lower than 25 mb or less is just chatting platform is not a game;
Useless;
I am simply a Threader;
Poorly tested and early version;
Good;
was able to download fine, but after a few days of settling in and enjoying the app, everything stopped working. I can't post. Can't reply to posts or even like posts that show up in my feed. I can't see any activity on the posts I was able to share - can't reply to anyone. All I can do is scroll my feed. And now with the launch of the desktop version, I can't access that either - won't even let me download. Way to lock people out, Meta.;
"""After watching you work so hard on your project, I know that you genuinely deserved this win. Congratulations on finishing your project and earning such high honors.""";
This app is like food or water. You need it to survive;
Karan Mourya;
Awful. What's the point ?!;
Good;
Need Like views;
wow 😲;
It's the Truth Social for Democrats. If you avoided Truth Social because of the right political BS, you will want to avoid this app. The app is clunky, glitched, and sometimes completely unresponsive. How can you trust a company to make a good app when their biggest announcement was releasing the website? Just uninstall it and move back to X (Twitter).;
Excellent first month. As new features are added, the user experience will certainly get even better;
There is no photo saving option...;
Does not work won't let me sign in;
super;
there are few trolls and bots on Threads, and the discourse is mostly respectful it's a big step up.;
Copy cat;
Wish I knew before I downloaded it if you deleted it. You would lose your instagram account.;
Very good;
Data not secured,;
Still waiting on hashtags, then 'll be happy.;
Great Experience 😀;
Good;
Good;
has high potential to become a great social media platform but lacks the polish and optimization needed on a modern day based app. would like to see future improvements;
Very bad 😔 app for me;
if it had edit I'd give it 6 stars;
Hvyv v vu;
ok;
Better than twitter;
It's a great app, It shows only personalized posts on its feed and we can choose the following mode only too. It'd be better if we can use hashtags and add shorts/reels though.;
Easy to use, trolls are easily blocked, and sharing content means you get sooo much more information each day, from like-minded individuals.;
This app is horrible. It simply does not even open, crashes straight back to the home screen. My phone specs aren't great, I will say that, but they should definitely be able to run a knock-off twitter.;
Copy;
Instagram & threads app is very good...but my view & like not coming,,plss instagram my view & like increase please;
So far so good. needs tweaking though. In time.;
Not quite there yet, but it's got it's good points, community, noticeable lack of obnoxious berks, I could go on , find out for yourself 👍;
It's really good, but Please add translator. Many thanks;
Very bad aap;
The only thing that made me delete it was its black icon, which doesn't match the dark mode of my phone;
ok;
I was accused of using a follower app and now have been blocked from posting. It's insanity at it's core.;
Super;
It is very useful and soft and safe social media platform. Thank you very much to meta for the app❣️❣️❣️🇮🇳🇮🇳;
mobile is okay, but i haven't been able to get desktop to work and none of my reports are getting answered.;
Always features to add but nice community.;
Rabi. Das;
Total waste;
Soooo much better than the dead bird dumpster fire.;
Useless;
Floods you with posts from people you don't follow, does not show your own posts to anyone else, just like Twitter.;
"Useless developers!!! I updated the app to the newest version again, but it still doesn't work and constantly says, ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again"". This is frustrating! I tried to clean cache and data, reinstall, different internet and wifi connections, with and without vpn, but nothing works. I truly want to use it, but I can't. :( I have sent the logs, but they are useless and can't fix it or change the message.";
need hashtags and search;
I like the variety of posts from all sorts of people and I don't feel the least but threatened when I post something. Most of my followers followed me first so I feel safe. 🤗;
message chat is missing yet;
so bad;
Better than Twitter. If you dislike n@zis drop Twitter and get Threads.;
My favourite new site. LOVE not having so many ads you cannot see content.;
A True Banger!;
Threads is all political garbage. It's just a sequel to what Twitter turned out to be after a while. I don't highly recommend it;
Interesting;
Good lord x/Twitter would be dead in an instant if this app had literally any features.;
Was fine ,until this last update. Now it sucks!;
❤️❤️;
love this app. simple, easy to use, and devoid of awful trolls.;
once all the features needed are installed, this app will be a five star.;
Useless wall of non-relevant posts from unknown accounts.;
Grover kheri aala 08;
Waste!! 🚮;
This is a good alternative to X/Twitter.;
Good 👍;
Such a nice place to be compared to X!!! Much less hate & MAGAt's .;
Pointless...reminds me of Twitter but less interesting;
"Feels like a particularly imperfect and unfinished beta version, but it has allowed me to ease my up and away flight from Facebook, which has now become a great void of old family members and(very) old friends to a new, less jaded crowd. I thrive on chaos; so it works for me - in this moment. Not sure how sticky it is. I've lost as many new followers as I've gained. Maybe because I don't know anybody here, they don't know me, and sometimes we end up following the wrong people.";
need videos a trend and for you section;
👍;
Nice app, not easy to navigate, maybe just not for me;
Unable to download;
'Threads' is a home base for me and it works quite well!🧠💪❤️🇺🇸;
Genuinely, this is one of the best apps I've ever used! I was never big on online friends/social media in general, but now I have a bunch of mooties who I genuinely like, people to talk to, and a place to talk about stuff 🥹💖 still, there are some things it lacks in terms of functionality, but I admit that changes and fixes roll out quickly! Great job with this 🩷🩷;
😴😴 very bowring App UI Design do not understand 😴😳😳;
restrictions on liking and adding ppl .. why then you put it in the first place;
its a copy of another app called twitter. i dont like copy cats. 0 creativity to create their own idea;
I like insta;
Love it here. So much better than xwitter. 😉;
miss the subject search that Twitter had;
Garbage. Just like Twitter.;
Reminds me of the early days of Facebook--no ads, I'm able to see friend's posts, political posts don't get buried, and I've seen precious few Nazis and no Elons. \o/ What's not to love?;
Twteer Copy Cat 😺;
Magnificent aap with tremendous possibility.;
I'm enjoying the experience, especially on the clock;
🤙;
What Threads need to have on desktop version is to be able to upload videos. It always have an error unless you regularly have to upload it on your phone instead.;
what can I say🤗;
خرا;
Absolutely, a refreshing experience 💯 on🪡. Seamless Experience. Total Fun. Absolute bliss. Renewed and New friendships.;
a couple of bugs, but generally ok. for a new app, I'm impressed ...;
Improvements keep coming, but I love the community here already.;
যুকার কাকা এতদিনে সময়োপযোগী একটা কাজের জিনিস মার্কেটে নামাতে পেরেছে। কিন্ত নতুনত্ব না থাকাই টিকবে না!;
I really like it but it's currently missing something. Threads should have a pinned thread feature like Twitter has. The pinned thread provides context to people visiting a profile and can provide additional/related resources. When I send someone a link to a Tweet I wrote, they see the pinned post on my Twitter and it provides additional context beyond what's in the short bio. Some profiles have pinned a long series of Tweets with a link in each Tweet, which provides centralized information.;
Wow very nice 👍;
Awesome 😎👍;
feels like a gimmick & not user friendly;
Subscribe;
good;
boring;
I really enjoy threads ❤️💙;
Thread has been so great since lunching and i love how smooth and user friendly it is. I am expecting more things like ads monetization, and so on.;
jost copying twitter (x);
As soon as I logged in, I suddenly required BLEACH after what I saw;
Very happy with the community on Threads and pleased to see the Zuck crew are rolling out enhancements and fixes fairly rapidly. I used to be a QA analyst in my employer's IT department and I've been impressed with how few issues there have been since the launch. Looking forward to future functionality upgrades.;
"Still all tabs/screens except news feed are shown with ""Something went wrong"". App is not usable. For two month no reaction, several reports sent and I'll better not use SM at all then using this...";
Ngl I forgot about this app but I was ok there was no point of it really 🤷‍♂️;
X is better. But I do admit, they didn't make it too similar to IG. It's more like if FB and X had a baby.;
Excellent alternative to Twitter.;
Elon love you;
I ❤️ threads it's a great way to connect with the 🌎 thank you Zack 😁;
I dont know;
A pleasant atmosphere and interactions in a place to throw my random thoughts;
it's just Twitter lite;
For my intents and purposes, threads is like a sticky note.;
For me the app is unusable. Not really the app itself but the feeds. My feed is almost entirely full of suggested threads to the extent that I never see posts from those I follow. It's kind of like tiktok for text.;
When the privacy policy rivals a Star Wars opening text, you know it's shady;
Great place to get news, engage with reasonable people and follow your favorite celebrities. More news and search is needed;
Love it.;
Very nice app;
twitter but cheap, also let us download the fkng images;
Why do we need another app tied to Instagram which is ultimately tied to facebook. And why is Instagram suggesting my friends requested me to download this garbage. -14 /10;
Poor , twitter is better;
Good;
missing the gif option 🥺🥺 must have please. an error that keeps showing my Threads are posting and never goes away lol. but in general I'm loving it. Honestly, I haven't seen another social media platform so safe for peeps. Threads is a place where you can express yourself, build community, make friendships and know you can be genuinely you. From the bottom of my 💙, thank you;
viable alternative to twitter, just needs to continue building out features and attracting and retaining users;
She's an icon. She's a Legend... And she is the moment, now come on now!!;
nice;
fantastic app, constantly improving, and great community;
excellent app did amazing job making it;
Pekooooook;
I love it;
Nice app am excited you no;
Still basically in beta testing and lacking essentially features but still so much better than the dead bird app.;
Found the best neurodivergent community on Threads.;
Thank you u sweet developers 🍠🍠🍠🍠🍠🍠;
Great platform.;
to not say zero🫣;
It's okay, but there's no following feed and the algorithm isn't great most of the time it doesn't show me things I'm interested in;
App is fine. The $15/mo BS to do what they should be doing, keeping our accounts safe, isn't. The play store is loaded with billionaires who do not care about these reviews, and that includes Google. We're not Forced to use either. It's a choice. That's clear. What isn't clear is the information, who it's sold to, and exactly what is collected from us, no matter the permissions on your device. Aside from all of this, the updates are staggering these days. That's Data breaches talking out loud;
Needs an explore/topic search feature, an edit button and the option to seperate your account from Instagram.;
Trying to be something it will never be.;
🤤🤤🤤🤤;
Very good app;
I have said my ideas for improvements both to the clients and the owner/moderators. What else can I say?;
a wonderful alternative to the bigoted musky ex app. growing & updating every day.;
Like;
Mara followers ghana vadva johi;
Dead already;
Piece of s;
Some improvements have been made, but needs bookmarks and hashtags badly. And better responses to reports of actual violence and death threats by other users. Overall am enjoying the app, much more friendly vibe here without the rampant hate.;
I appreciate the chance to have something similar to Twitter of old. but there are so many features missing that honestly just make it a waste of time. the inability to use functional hash tags is a huge one, especially for people relying on social media for their small businesses or art commissions. no edit button. just several other little things that need improvement.;
greatest app i have ever used in my life on god if yall need a representative or commercial figure please let me know!;
enjoy viewing the different threads, ease of use. still wish they had an edit/delete button, way of categorizing content, and mode for saving favorite posts/threads.;
♥️♥️♥️;
Better than the other place because the community isn't full of negative ppl. It's still early days of course but the app is usable and is being developed, with regular updates.;
Aarish Salmani Sahab ji;
REMOVED. A waste of space, a waste of time. It's pure spam, an advertising platform and showing and pushing posts from accounts I don't follow nor do I have any interest in. I accept there has to be some advertising, but this is beyond OTT! There's nothing encouraging me to stick with it. I get more than enough adverts and spam from all over the place. I'm NOT canon fodder.;
copy of twitter;
need hashtags, gifs, and chronological timeline DESPERATELY.;
it's halfway done. Get to work;
Dumb den jg sag sag r fm tess;
Am i suppose to be replacing X by this thing !!?? No I don't think so zuck . You better make it worth my time.;
This app is vender full and you are try this aap..........;
absolutely app and amazing;
nhi;
Good but twitter is better.;
Nice;
The Threads logo looks like Eggdrops' logo;
we need favorite to save what we love;
its very helpful;
Absolutely no need for this app whatsoever. It's all been done before.;
😀;
@threads is already a wonderful place to be. Proper, intelligent engagement with like-minded souls, more so than I've experienced on any social app. Especially on politics, which has been a joy! But there are frustrations: a 'sticky' feed that doesn't make sense chronogically. Over-focus on the last person you reacted to from the algorithm. No topic search facility, and little content from top UK brands and news outlets. Please sell hard to them! 🙏 Great work, Threadmeisters - it's fun here!;
The app is very boring. Twitter is much better;
Xnxx aata hi ni h isme download krna hi bekar h;
It's okay. I just don't have many close friends and family that use it. My following and interactions on the app has been slower than I thought or expected. Although, it has only been out to the public for a few months. I will keep it for now.;
superb;
I love it;
The app is good so far. It is fairly new and is still being worked on but I'd recommend it.;
Beat Twitter as fast as possible;
Tap to enlarge videos, tap volume for sound and often the video freezes. Please fix.;
Threads is my number one 💜💜💜;
Thik h pr mere followers to ab bhi nhi bad re 😶🙄;
Nice aap;
Twitter copy;
love it;
It doesn’t share stories to Facebook.;
Way better than Twitter.;
Can't upload photos on threads after update.🖐️☹️;
Great alternative to X. Has potential to be way better;
You should add darkmode to this platform please;
Works brilliantly. However, some needed functions are missing since its release. A decent search, hashtags, better management of threads (keeping follows and global separate).;
Best 👌;
It sucks, but I prefer it to the other choice.🤷🏼;
Nazia Pathan;
Far superior to the other similar social media apps that I have tried.;
Like comment follow and virl video plz;
a great Alternative to Twitter as it feels like 2015 Twitter before the MAGAs and Elon Musk pretended all ideas are equal and lying is acceptable behaviour, I recommend Theads 100% as it's slowly gaining more features and I love how every attempt by the crowd who ruined twitter come there then run away as there not welcome, also the sensible censorship makes it an app I'd be fine see kids using unlike twitter which is basically 4chan lite now. Nothing more pleasant then a gore free social media.;
Copy of Twitter mark Zuckerberg just wanted to be like king Elon Musk;
A work in progress, I think. It needs to improve navigation and search options.;
three stars coz I want zuck to still update the app;
Worst;
"i love it but can being more freedom like X because ""something"" is prohibited to post...";
A decent replacement for TwiX in more ways than one, and getting better all the time.;
The is awesome but my problem is the app won't let me do anything and I can't follow anyone please fix it;
Really great way of communicating with like minded people...;
cant hide the threads badge in instagram profile;
Good;
3 stars for now. The app still needs more features to get it to 5 stars. But other than that, works like a charm.;
Buggy with greyed posts;
Bruv i cant evan log in it says the password wrong also it looks like a straight copy of Twitter and a lil rebanding;
Worst social media app I have tried isko dekh kr social media se man htt gya yrr;
For me, Threads came out from nowhere and hit the ground running. The functionality has a ways to go, and they will get there. I am very happy to see so many familiar accounts and am pleased with the content.;
Amazing app;
Good;
Lakin is Sy hota Kya hai 🤔;
One of the worst app ever seen 😠;
this is an amazing app;
Could you not put a edit feature into it I always found it frustrating that you could not edit on twitter i mean there's no need to copy twitter down to the last i you could just improve on it and a edit feature would be brilliant...;
An atmosphere that I enjoy the people that are on here. We are a silly family😃. The only thing that drives me crazy is that I cannot use my gif. I have to go download them. other than that I love Treads🫶;
Its Twitter, without the harassment;
"It is so empty... ""Trending"" section would really help";
Useless;
Good app;
just like instgram good use;
good;
Threads it's getting steadily better. Once it gets a search feature it will bury X once and for all.;
ainda falta muito;
great fun love the vibes;
nice app;
🫀🫀;
Threads for the entry-level to the expert writers. 🏆;
I love the app, but I never use it, I think it has potential but it lacks a lot;
I like it. Could use some work on engaging a new audience however it is a great platform. 👍🏽 👌;
Nice;
introduce message and voice option plz;
refresh my timeline without me having to reboot my phone. Thanks;
it's a helpful app;
A big fat failure of an app;
They finally implemented search (should have been a day 1 feature) and it doesn't show results in chronological order. Uninstalling.;
Nothing Special 👎;
op;
It's okay, needs to grow. I do like the more positive tone. Zuck needs to stop the news shenanigans.;
You don't need X for breaking news. You can search keywords on Threads now🤙;
it's awesome and working good;
fix some bugs;
still needs hashtags (or similar) but a nicer place to be than X;
social media without the hatred;
Good! Needs a few more features to be great.;
best app;
worst;
loving it. more functionality is coming regularly & the community we are building by blocking MAGAMORONS is delightful;
Mal ting;
Peace & Safety. God Bless Y'all☀️☀️☀️☀️;

A worthy successor to the dead bird...;
I really enjoy it!;
I Know Threads Is In Live BETA Test Mode With Possible 100 Million Percentages Of Users Sticking Around & Using Threads, & Lots Bugs 🐛 🙄 ,However Zuckerberg & Mosseri Cannot Manage Me #Scott1984FP Like: #Mastodon.Social Can, #Tumblr Can, & Before Loosing My August 2009 - 2023 Twitter X Account They Too Could Cope With My Likes/Heart Favourites, Reposts, Quotes, Shares, Replies,Longer Posts & More :( Heart Liking My Own & Others Instagram Posts Don't Harrm Anyone/Nor Make Me Income Either 😞;
I really liked it i mean just loved it because i can share my opinion;
"Needs some tweaks, (like translate), but would take it ANY DAY over the platform formerly known as Twitter- the cesspool of opinions. You can even report and know it matters;) ANY day!!";
It's twitter with the parental controls turned to 11.;
Where grown ups go to talk☺️;
copying and pasting has some issues. searching topics would be nice and a short term edit feature would be an improvement thank you for asking;
It's a world away from the horror that Twitter has become. Facts, intelligence, and empathy reign supreme.;
I love the communities, the connections, and the app is fun! My only wish is they would add an edit button;
Top;
It's incorporating better features as time goes on, and I'm building a better community than I found on its predecessor, its ex.;
Very bad copy of twitter;
Hopefully we will see this app improved so I can increase my rating. Currently there is still enough functionality missing to knock it down a couple stars.;
Excellent start impressive in fact. It'll get higher than 3 stars when they figure out how to show me stuff closer to real time especially during sports. probably should do a Superbowl add encouraging people to threet about the game.;
"Less hate on threads than on ""X"".";
Still a long way to go to search topics, find subject matter experts, and be found by those not family or friends already. But it does feel less angry and toxic than Twitter.;
Why is my badge still there when I dont even have a profile?;
dull af;
Bad;
way better than being a bird...;
Trolls few and far between. No Musky stank on the app.;
Better than Twitter;
Super app;
I've found THREADS to be a wonderful place to meet and connect with new friends and business colleagues. I'm so impressed with the upbeat climate and the motivational posts that fuel each of us to keep pushing for a better place to converse and do business. Congratulations, Threads. Keep growing this fabulous Oak Tree.;
trash 🗑️✴️;
Very nice app 👌;
great app with good vibes. needs more functionality like custom tags, polls, monetizing, and custom notifications;
follow me;
Great;
Hotel King 👑💖;
@misty_gumber_123;
"I prefer ""X"" ,,Mark zakazak...u can keep ur fake Twitter that has no privacy";
it's getting better...;
I wish I could save photos;
Since it's from meta, I'll always be a *****;
Copyright content;
❤️❤️❤️;
Now that search is up and running, this feels way more like a proper Twitter replacement. There are a few quality of life things that would help, like trending topics and hashtags, but, for now, it's pretty great!;
Meet at the new spot!;
It's a very good app I love it💙💙;
🌳Freedom to post ⛰️ Thank you Threads ✌️;
Not good experience....need a lot more correction;
Still developing its core features but honestly, I really dig this app. Been checking it regularly since launch. It even got me to start paying attention to my Instagram again.;
It's getting there.;
I like it. Simple And easy to use.;
with trending feature included in the next update, threads can be wild;
Bad then Instagram;
I do like it. I like the atmosphere better than any social site so far. It's difficult to leave a critical review when I know it's not a finished project but it does leave quite a few features to be desired.;
Not acceptable in front of X;
Was kind of hoping for more here, but it's non functional. It'd be just what us migrants from X wanted, if the app wasn't a buggy mess. Don't bother if you want to actually communicate with people: posting or uploading doesn't work at all.;
With the introduction of search, this app is rapidly becoming the real deal. improvements keep coming on a regular basis.;
100% AWESOME;
Its a good replacment twitter when you want get away from how toxic twitter is. But I would like a following page so i can see the posts from people i follow instead of them including people i don't.;
There's nothing which will make you hooked up with this app like instagram and if you have free wifi then download this for nothing. X is far better than this. X has a lot more potential than this. This is just ctrl V of it.;
𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞;
Unfair n restricts free speech , only selective;
I can't log in to my Instagram or meta account to use threads. I checked several times, my info was correct. It's excruciating.;
The app is good but it needs new features like the message tab and like trending topics;
Threads is like Twitter but good;
good, continues to develop.;
Where is that search option? I can only search people.;
Itz officail my fb insta good threadson;
cool party;
mind blowing;
Nice;
Nice you Threads app to atajh on Instagram;
trending topics need to be updated more;
Why am I seeing a bunch of posts from random accounts I don't follow???;
Requiring an account in another social media site is absurd. I don't want an Instagram account. Total fail on Meta's part.;
really good. could use a dedicated messaging center in-app.;
🥺🥺💔💔💔 Sunil Nishad 💔💔💔🥺🥺;
Friendly, easy to use, great atmosphere;
I wish there was a desktop version. if there was that I'd give 5 stars⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. Much better than Twitter X.;
Such an useless app, if I could give it zero start, I would've given it a zero star;
Please Don't download your browser your History can be steal be safe;
Great stuff. Getting better and better every week/month.;
A more enjoyable experience here than you know where.;
Great Communication with no * Funny Stuff* as in that Stupid X . Twitter and Bird I was used to. but that X is as Eerie as it's owner.. Thanks to Mark Zuckerberg for making Social Media tolerable...;
Copycat L 👎;
Another boring scrolling app..;
I can see posts but that's about it. I can't see replies (so what even is a thread?) nor can I see anything in activity. It's been stuck this way for weeks.;
It's nice though but the need for hashtags is a must have feature so meta please make this possible in the next update;
amazing 👏;
its an amazing aap.;
Tqq;
easy to use;
Twitter is better😭😂🤝🏼;
IG's awful AI flagged my IG account as a bot, an account that I've had for years, right after I installed this app. Permanently suspended me so that my account is now unrecoverable. What an experience. Wouldn't install again.;
Needs Switch account feature!!;
Its amazing;
Threads its great!;
For now, this is way better than Twitter. No ads, very little nastiness, and much like Twitter when it first started.;
Useless app. Third class copy;
You need to fix the erros and bugs. I haven't been able to see my likes or follows since I created my profile. I don't see the point of dragging with this app if it doesn't work. At the moment, I can only see the news feed, and I can't even post anything.;
nice;
As soon i open this app;
Threads feels nice to be on, hope that atmosphere stays (and it has web and search now if that matters to you);
Not possible to delete threads account without deleting Instagram account.;
3 rd class;
Good;
Good;
Threads application is very good;
Needs to have DM capability,edit,and an easier way to find out if people you've followed are following back.;
getting way better. still missing features but golly what an improvement over the dumpster fire that was a great site;
At first, I was wondering why we need another social media app. Now I can't get enough!!! This one is different. I love it.;
Good;
"wonderfull app. less nazis than brand ""X"". Easy to use.";
"One big annoyance right now is that there isn't an option to skip loading links in the internal browser. I'd like to load links externally with my preferred browser instead. The app also frequently jumps back to the ""For you"" feed rather than sticking with the ""Following"" view (and ""Following"" seems pretty buggy where it doesn't really refresh properly).";
終於修好了;
I loved the black and white, looking classy.;
Rudra Mondal;
Wow;
Very nice 👍;
I like this app this app is wonderful and beautiful this app is useful and it app using them Instagram any two Instagram brothers.....;
i need you to add a : - pin for threads, - threads bookmarks - availablity for promotion;
There's been a lot of progress, which is good. There's still a long way to go, but desktop helps older people like me. The community here is great, better than the other place 👍;
@ronaldo;
"I like threads because I'm not trolled by MAGAs here as much as the ""other"" platform. It could use a bit of tweaking though, like an easier way to tell which activities you've already seen, an EDIT button and a saved draft option. Other than those things, it's great😊";
but we need a damn edit button already!! stop whatever your doing and please gimme gimme an edit button. thankyou;
X is best;
🔱🚨❤️;
After i downloaded it made my Instagram following different it keeps unfollowing people;
Like that other threads app that shall remain nameless (X), this one needs an edit button. Instagram and Facebook have them, why not Threads?;
Just name it as Twitter you thief;
❤️🙏🙏;
Best 👍🏽;
My Space....my threads;
Uninstalled... Waste of time. Another failed app brought to you by the Zuck.;
A solid platform. Always room for improvement.;
Nice;
So far, it's been a positive experience.;
Though, still in the early stages and still lacks a few features, Threads had a potential to grow, and the recently implemented keyword search feature really helps a lot! I'm looking forward to seeing what Meta brings to the table with their new Threads social media app! And, I hope to grow a community on there as well to support Disney's underrated animated series, 101 Dalmatian Street!😁;
Could and should be more developed by now. It's good now but needs more features and basics to truly put X out to pasture.;
I love it. I never got into the other place but this is friendly, supportive and fun. It's so nice to not have nasties spoiling it. Now we have a search which is fab. 😊;
Very good;
Super positive community 💙;
better moderation of content, less prone to seeing hate content.;
Sasta Twitter or I say X;
I love this app m daughter loves it too;
It glitches and some of the features are missing;
Way, way, way better than the xitter.;
I love it! Adult political discourse. We all look out for one another!;
Nothing to do;
A scam website is coded better than this app;
Greatt appp ✨;
Best Xitter replacement out there. And getting better. I know it will be BETTER than Twitter in the long run.;
Very nice;
it's good;
This is actually a really nice app. I've found a great community on here. And while other reviews are right that it's missing things, they ship more stuff every week (good stuff! Features not bugs!). Most basics are working, everything else is in the pipeline.;
sweet and classy;
I'm more than upset!! I'm angry and irritated!! I regret installing this app! I want to delete it but I can't. I feel like I'm being held hostage. I also want the icon removed from my IG account but there's no way to remove that. Of course! I've Googled and tried EVERYTHING! It's still there. They should have created a disclaimer to warn people (before installation) that there is no option to delete without deleting IG too. They're out of line for this. 🤬🤬;
Copy of X(twitter);
Absolutely love this app. Great place to follow others with your same interests. Plus zero ads.;
Se suponía que iba a ser lo máximo, pero se ha quedado corto y veo que mucha gente ya ni sube threads;
a bit easier on the heart and head than Twitter or whatever we're calling it these days still has a ways to go, but strides are made weekly to improve the experience;
Constantly crashes on opening;
Very boooooooooooooooring program!!;
A healthier more relaxing version of social media;
looooove!;
Quite poor. Still lacking so many features.;
tfffffimfc is o;
After elon mask buy twitter twitter is so bad;
love the app for my experience it a great app now I can search for what I want. I can have my Instagram account;
Better than TwiX!;
Better than standing on the roof of a tall building screaming your lungs out!;
Bad;
Early days still, but very usable. Features are being added. Lots of creatives!;
love threads great community and brilliant content.;
This scratches my political itch.;
Metaverse is amazing in a wild way. Mark Zuckerberg is my payyeee..and Eliana payee he watches both of JWSTEMM;
Good;
Yaaaaak5🤢;
dopee funn postinggg decent engagement good energy at least on my feed. nicee 💫;
Thik;
still glitches... like my phantom posts... that show up every time I open the app;
Average;
it allows me to have more direct communication about my artistry with my fans and I love that as a music artist. thank you, Meta.;
Golusharma;
so;
Threads is the shiznit!;
good community being built but needs more features;
cool;
better than X;
I'd love to be able to like and/or comment on the main page rather than have to open every post 👍🏼;

love this app;
incomplete especially on the web but a good start;
Mini twitter;
love threads!!!!;
holds your account hostage by making you delete your Instagram account to quit. tracks too much personal data. Looks to destabilize the Fediverse.;
less features, more fun.. lov it🫶🏻;
Useless app;
Not good;
Forced to keep account otherwise insta account will be deleted.;
"So far, so good! Developers need to roll out more/better capabilities in order to hasten the demise of the ""bird!"" It wouldn't hurt to also announce the roll outs rather than depending on word of mouth i.e. list the enhancements being worked on.";

Not a good app. It's not like twitter but only like instagram.;
useless;
Sushe;

Good Nice App 😘😍🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👌❤️👌;
pretty good, certainly a lot more friendly than T or is it X, would like to see the use of hashtags included.;
Nice app;
love it 😍❤️😍;
Good;
For me this the worst app in my life 👎🏼 and we can't Hashtag and promote as well.;
༺FØllØ𝕨༻;

Treads To Shreds;
Very nice;

I accidentally deleted my threads badge from Instagram profile so please let me know how can get it on my profile?;
Worst timeline in social media apps. Can't personalize, can't modify anything. Search is bad/weak. Used for like a week and stopped using completely.;
Nice app;
Önemli değil ve kullanışlı değil;
So far a nice alternative to the Blue Bird, but there are still a few features like trends, hashtags, and news feeds that need to be Incorporated. Once the app becomes more robust, I'll add more stars.;
copied...;

wow;
فيه ذبات تجنن;
Great;
I'm unable to login to threads over pc.;
please vairel me;
absolutely love Threads 🙏🏻👍🏻;
Chinese twitter rip off;
Need edit button and hashtags;
It's ok but the lack options, hashtags etc is killing it;
Videos get stuck often. On the upside, it's not owned by Musk.;
Awesome app🔥🔥🔥;
Happiness;
"threads is a friendlier version of the app ""formerly known as Twitter"". As long as it stays that way, I will be glad to use it.";
make me popular 😂;
ಸೂಪರ್;
please show option for id thread to appear again on IG, cuz i accidentally deleted it. i really want to show my id thread on IG again.;
great vibe, easy to use, and good fun.;
Stop forcing me to get this app downloaded 😡😡😡😡😡😡 I'm not interested;
Excellent forum for public discourse.;
Thoroughly Enjoyable;
loving it.. needs more enhancements and upgrades... but definitely its my play now not going back to twitter anymore... I hope it stays ad-free;
a social app with heart and kindness.;
It's better than Twitter 😀😀;
the app is superb 😘😂😂;
this app is so nice;

great application ever 💙;

Stop extracting user data for your profit;
Excellent Friendly Platform 100% better than the bird.Give it a try.;
So far so good now we need more government officials on the site to notify them of things. Huge improvement over Twitter or X whatever they call themselves.;
nice 🙂👍;
SUCKED!!!!;
Good for nothing, app. I didn't get what value it would it bring to me and tried to imagine why others should use it unfortunately, couldn't find any function that can benefit users. But I feel like they will add some of the game-changing functions that will give some hope to the app.;
better than X;
Gooooood;
Supar nice bro;
BORING!;
I love the atmosphere of threads and it's extremely close to being as good as pre-elon Twitter...needs hashtags and trending topics to make it a source for news;
Not that good You can't search for Threads on the search side Please develope that;
إنّ الكَلامَ لَفِي الفُؤادِ وإنّما جُعِلَ ال (Threads) علَى الفُؤادِ دَليلًا;
I liked the app cause I can repost anything lmao;
Good;
I jumped ship from Twitter to Threads when it went online. So far the experience has been much better and I hope this continues into the future.;
I was on the Bird App from way back, '06. It got bad and went worse, and I was sucked right into that scene, and a lot of its weird and angry discourse. There was a point where I found people that I could relate to, and there were cool things, and it went to Hell. Threads is working to be the good version of this, I think, if only to spite Musk. I think that's a great reason to build a place where the good parts of Twitter thrive. Threads, Ho! Thanks for the great free product! Great work!;
Great app that's getting better all the time. They keep adding more and more functionality.;
Threads is better than Twitter, because it is fast than Twitter and it's amazing to joined both apps Instagram and threads.;
You should use twitter;
Still much to be desired as far as Quality of Life features, but remains infinitely preferable to Twitter. A safer social media experience, though being a Meta IP you have to live with the personal information storage/mining/sharing.;
This app is a disappointment, it's lacking so much compared to most major social medias.;
can't search too easy can't find people location tagging does not work no Hashtags;
👌👌;
Lot to work on, yes the future is bright. The app has potential.;
So cool to have this. Easy to use, great community, lots of news etc. Haven't used X-itter in months.;
The stricter, lamer, helicoptoparented, version of Twitter, minus all the fun parts and with more spying.;
Love the app! Goodbye Twitter/X!;
Switch to threads its better than twitter;
needs # and loolk for topics options;
its okay it just the creater wont be able to see hi/her replies;
Better than that other one.;
private inbox not available 😕;
No porn .. or even skin for that matter... lol. Can be a good thing but not what I was looking for;
I really like the app. Continued listening to users, updating & getting better. I'm no longer a twit.;
It has less/inferior features than X and the scrolling is buggy/unresponsive 90% of the time (that's the only app I have seen with this problem).;
Very nice bro;
The app is still in its larval stage, not quite mature, but it's getting better all the time. Also, right-wing psychopath trolls are at a minimum, at least in the early stages.;
impossible to register and maintain an account, Error;
Satisfied;
Very good;
It's like Twitter/X and Instagram combined but better;
We already have X;
Pintu;
Thaeds an good;
great work everyone spreading good vibes around threads!;
Oooop;
Best app;
Nice;
Ive used this app on my other ph and its so amazing...even tho it doesnt have a messenger it still rocks...at least i can post status on it whereas i cant do on instagram...thanks much...🖤;

nice try;
Why did we need this app at all, in the first place?... Just another clone of Twitter and alike, pointless.;

Nice 👍🙂;
Useless if you have Instagram already;

Something new. From Instagram app.;
Nice app;
knock off twitter not even good died after a week;
Far too light on features and a weak algorithm for suggesting content.;
One of the best alternatives to X and getting better!;
so much better than the spurious bile of Xwitter;
The app is open and the app store has been working and treand app has been working and is working fine now;
Why thread? I feel it's same as Instagram.. just meta making everyone fool just creating same app with different name;
"this is easy better than ""X""";
It's not Twitter. What else is needed as a recommendation?;
better than racist, Nazi Twitter. would like to see more hot guys though;
Unusable. I can read posts but not respond or view any replies. I have un installed and re installed countless times to no avail. I'm not going back to twitter till Musk goes but Threads is a waste of time.;
Sharukh Salmani;
first ever social media platform I actually like. Threads is really great.;
Interesting app;
much prefer instagram.;
Good;
well;
If it was just a dark mode it will be fantastic;
I love it so much but the only thing is I accidentally pressed the hide badge that is connected in my Instagram bio and I was sad i googled it and sadly it says you can't add it back when you remove it☹️, please help me get the badge and please fix this!☹️ 🙏🙏;
Please change the logo , it look like indian tamil word so Please change the logo.;
dumbest most pointless app that does nothing different than the 8 other social media apps. engagement is god awful even with fresh followers. app was dead before it was ever alive. pointless.;
1m flower kar do ,🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰;
It easier to gain and to grow📈;
A place where woke is not a dirty word and people are supportive towards each other. Somewhere you can ask about what you know nothing about and people will answer without insults. Getting better with every update. A good place for X Xers tired of the toxicity.;
Just keeps getting better and better and shows some great topics from your interests.;
It would be a five star if (or will be when) I had the ability to make lists or groups or some means with which to group the people I follow and pull those threads up together at will. I want to have family, writers, artists, politicians, news, etc easily grouped. I still go to the X mess to see my FIRST list for trusted news in the morning. Would rather do it here.;
This app is very annoying please do not install this app if you have installed this app and created an account It is linked with your Instagram account and if you want to delete this app, then your Instagram account will also be deleted.;
Like ❤️;
Hi I really like insta threads;
Good aap;
🤗🤗🤗🤗;

Great app, let's threading 🍵🧵;
Rakesh bhai;
It's so good 👍😊;
Still needs a few options added. Keep up the good work !;
Thanku;
nice 👍👍;
Very boring;
I am loving this app-♥️. Way to go Meta-👍🏿!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐;
I'm enjoying Threads !!!!;
😀😀😀😀;
is a very helpful for this one app that's a good and i like it ❤😘;
Love it. Love Instagram and Threads;
Yes I have to be a good night and I will be in the tuu hii and I you you;
Worst aap ever 😓;
भावनाओं से उतपन्न विचारों को व्यक्त करने का अच्छा मंच 🌸;
Thank you 😊;
Excellent photos and type space as well great app.;
I hate when Threads doesn't rotate on my device. We are in 2023, not in 2000. Also, threads is very ugly compared to Twitter. I dislike Elon but Threads has more functionalities than Threads. Zuck knows Threads is a copy of Instagram.;
👍👍;
It's good with keeping up with friends and their posts.;
Like a best app I have past some days. And user experience is so friendly;
great app;
Kya malum is me kya hai ake dekho 😂;
Extremely unresponsive. As soon as I open the application, the screen scrolling gets crazy and absolutely unreadable.;
The app lacks the search option to seek specific topics based on a keyword. It claims that it offers it and even notified me that I can use it. But when I boot up the app and try using a keyword to search for any posts discussing a specific topic, it just shows me the usual boring list of accounts that are using that keyword as their user name. It amazes me that such a basic function is not yet widely available.;
Nice;
Very good;
nice;
Please add how the feature like how many engaged to a post etc;
no hashtag support yet.;
-no rooms for dm's -no room to choose topic/s of interest -thread should be an app of its own and not tied with IG;
Best of all time;
Missing a lot of features, but it has a chance.;
Looking forward to updates to bring even more functionality, like editing, to the app.;
Not the best app right now, but hoping on new features to come;
perfectly good and steadily getting better.;
I Enjoy This App. I Hope to make A living From Threads Someday.;
less static than the maniac many feel comfortable here which makes this a good experience similar CoSo with higher speed;
It's improving every week!;
This looks less like a twitter clone and more like a Facebook comment box where people are fighting or nagging. Not recommended.;
way better than twitter;
need long minutes to move other slide;
Bad;
I want an edit button;
The translator tab this morning has not been working. After deleting and redownloading the app, the translation tab is no longer present.;
No way to disable autoplay of videos making the app completely useless.;
"Hmmm...🧐🤔 So far so good. I actually like the simplicity of the platform right now and I think it has great potential to evolve into ""itself"" instead of being known as a ""copycat counterfeit of 'Twitter' (AKA ""X"")""...";
Perfect;
AWESOME;
It's not Twitter, and that's good enough for me. Work on the hash tag stuff, and it will be fine.;
cool;
l love threads, but my challenge is l can't share from threads to other apps. l don't know what's gone wrong?;
Needs an Edit Button please. I use my 65 year old thumb to communicate with and sometimes it loses its way. Please an edit button. I would love to see a follower tag on my list. Just a 💡.;
Good morning;
Wow;

There's no edit button. I shouldn't have to hide the post and recreate it to correct a small mistake.;
Spam 🤬🤬;
अपनी बात रखने की सबसे उत्तम जगह;
great potential but it launched way too early. still, no Nazis yet.;

The app can be very quirky, and the service support appears to be non-existent. in order to compete with Twitter, more features and stability needs to be in place.;
Nothing is special;
Excellent;

Useless platform 👎 ...not better than x ( previously known as twitter );
Threads;
Hame bhi 100k followers karana hai;
please add an edit button so we can edit our threads. thanks!;
Good;
"Legit ""X"" or Twitter Mark Zuckerberg trina 1 up elon musk";
At first it was great. But then I started running into a lot of problems on this app. And I don't get why I have to have Instagram, ( I'm a 55 year old man who really doesn't care about Instagram why is it necessary for me to have it to get threads.🤬) robert 7909johnson soon-to-be leaving threads good luck everyone. 8/23/23.update still having problems 🤬 9/11/23 still 😡.. i think im done.;
Lawra walla app hai thui;
Nontoxic;
niceeeee;
Useless social media app that doesn't let you permanently delete your account without having to permanently delete my Instagram account.;
Great app;
Twitter;
nice is threads 👌.......;
nah, please don't push something that already exists onto us. twitter's toxic and this new app thats introduced is going to be just the same.;
love it;
Itna khas nahin hai 😊;
Nice aap;
love it. my opinion.;
Great 👍;
Good;
nice;
love it. No fighting. No disgusting hate filled posts. It's clean and easy.;
Happy mood💫😚;
I feel better here;

The keyword search is going to help a lot. it must be promoted for use on the site.;
Never did like my exes...;
Nice aap;
Good;
so far, so good... editing option would be great.;
Net sloved;
Since updating app to obtain search capability, I now can't post anything...😥;
Copy cat;
It's useless;
better than twitter.;
Good;
Didn't think I would find use for this app until I realized I could share my thread posts to my IG story with a touch of a button. I think that is where it hits big. 🔥;
amazing app.. specially the peeps over here are fab;
Awesome;
A really fun way to be expressive and interact with others;
video viral nhi hota hai sir ji;
Not worth it 😔;
Normally everywhere good Threads all the way;
Rahit king Rahit king;
The best Twitter replacement, but still needs work. Needs hashtags and better notification settings;
Good app;
I love this app. The Spartan interface at first was a little off-putting, but the people are great. this is a very positive environment and monumentally superior to the cesspool of hatred that other platforms cultivate. I have no complaints about the app whatsoever.;
This is better ,;
കൊള്ളാം ഡാ . Instagram premium പോലെ ഉണ്ട് 🙂🥱;
A gimmick aimed at exploiting the Twitter exodus. Only difference b/w this & regular IG is that the text is above the photo and not below. Also first thing I log in and see is pictures of young girls (minors) with random men (many of whom I suspect would be adults) commenting on it. Terrible content moderation although I'm sure there's nothing here that wouldn't already be on the regular app.;
This app is the worse version of twitter;
Love the clean look and feel and the more positive vibe. Have permanently left the 'other' place. (Am finding that I spend more time on Threads than I ever did there.) Patiently waiting as new features roll out.;
Cool 😎 😴;
Good app;

Not too good;
wonderful;
Developing social media site that is rapidly becoming a FULL replacement for Twitter;
better than twitter, performs well;
still fairly new and devs are working out the kinks. Overall a pleasant experience so far;
Just get X;
N/a;
Nice, keeps me informed;
I love the app;
Ooo bhai sahi he reels m network jata tha aab nahi Jaye ga 😇🥴🖤;
Not good enough;
A welcoming, non-trollish community with lots of clever people. Good engagement levels. Worth it.;
I just miss the old threads which contains only direct messages so you can focus more . I will be happy if it comes back with another name;
"They are called ""stitches"" and they are in ""seams"" so don't forget it! The pendulum is definitely swinging towards the middle in terms of content quality.";
great replacement for Twitter. much more positive, informative and uplifting.;
outstanding a beautulifull loved it;
🐥🐥;
Updated to the new app and just keeps logging me out;
using same fact checkers,as IG ,you get restricted on one but no both for price of one;
easy to use, nice atmosphere, needs editing;
My real rating would be four cause there's room for it to improve, but that's not how the algorithm works.;
Que publicadas tan invasora para descargar una app que sobra;
Getting better every day very glad to have a replacement for Twitter which sucks;
whenever I upload multimedia, I think that they get uploaded already after some time of letting it upload. But the next day when I check on my posts apparently they weren't uploaded so I have to do it again. it ruins my schedule of content posting;
Never works. Error then force closes. Worked day 1 then I haven't been able to get it to work on any of my devices since.;
Boof;
Don't copy;
Haharawak ge;
good;
The app functionality is coming along, but it will get one star from me as long as it fails to support my tablet in a horizontal/landscape orientation.;
A|eemqureshi;
It's not X!;
this app is awesome!;
nice;
shailendra;
Waow;
New but good;
Mast Hain Bhai nice aap;
Unable to delete account.;
as;
cheap Twitter;
Ok;
Mid. For an app called Threads, it's very disconnected. No DM, no groups, and missing most features modern social media has. Not looking to get popular just connect to people on topics and have a good time. This is currently not that app.;
great to discribe;
It's just a cheap copy of Twitter now called X;
I like it 💚;
The app lacks options, but of what is there it works.;
nice;
nice 👍🔥;
No privacy.;
superb;
Good;
Very bad services;
I love u Thread;
This app is the best community app to grow positively and like I defined threads. “ We are all connected from different part of the world in a web of thread through the metaverse.” Thanks to my boss Zuck and the META team.☺️✌️;
so happy this platform came into being. so easy to gain many followers, with intelligent, thoughtful conversations. it's fun watching it grow;
Worst app 🙂;
Good 😊;
Excellent 👍🏻;
🙂🕊;
A safe, spam-free environment for meta users to be able to transfer their data and give them a chance to clean facebook up, without losing your profile.;
Vijay VIjayan;
good;
👍;
Rohit Chauhan 🙏;
"please fix the password reset functionality so I can use the desktop version. I love the app, 5 stars, but it's annoying seeing devs pat themselves on the back that ""everyone has access to desktop now"" when I can't log in.";
Good 👍;
You can play the video but when you try to turn the volume on, the video stop. Please fix it!;
GHOOOSSSHHHH FINALLY THE ONE THAT I WANTED. ITS SO WELL ORGANIZED AND ALSO I REALLY LIKE HOW ITS NOT SO MESSY.;
Good;
Nobody uses this garbanjo;
pookie good;
This is very nice app;
This app is bahut he bekar app hai faltu cheej hai yea;
Censors medical facts.;
Bored. Needs sortabe by date hashtags ASAP!;
Still has some kinks to work out and lacks some functionality, but fast becoming my go to social media platform;
Love you this bike;
nice app;
"Overall I like the app but now it's stopped working. All I get is ""something went wrong"" in my feed and nothing else. I've rebooted the phone, cleared the cache, deleted all the data, uninstalled/reinstalled, signed out/in, nothing fixes it. It's a 1-way street where I can post, and see what I've posted, but that's it. Hope it gets fixed soon.";
Cute and beautiful ❤️ love you ❤️😻;
No any meaning this apps.;
The day when I installed this aap it was good but now it's like there's a bug problem and it's always crashing 😭 after clearing cashe and reinstalled this AAP;
very nice;
Awesome;
Excellent ❤️❤️❤️😊😊;
outstanding;
Better than alternative. Engagement is real not bots and engagement level is higher than any other platform. They still need to add features for better search and topics but they are adding as they go.;
So far so good.;
seems interesting ❤️‍🩹;
what is this;
So worst app this;
Nice 👌❤️;
Very poor app ....X is far better;
Remove and add on insta bio threads;
nyc ap❤️💫💥;
I found it Useless.;
Dewakhan25;
Incredible what amazing app;
I was curious so i downloaded it. They've already started censoring content about the rona and tbh the app itself is pretty dull. It has potential, but as long as it's being ran by Meta, it won't go anywhere.;
Can't reply to or repost my own comments. It says I need to be followed by me to do this!!!;
It's cuteee;
A much kinder, happier place than the other similar socmed sites (so far). Still working out a few UX issues.;
Beautiful;
It's slow, hard to copy and paste into posts, and I have no way of knowing if a post violates community standards. Reach is non-existent for some reason.;
It's still in its early days, but it's a fantastically made app with great performance and usability, and the service overall is just fun to use;
Good;
Very good 👍;
Also a download option, as well as visible buttons for videos (play, mute, etc.).;
Sheh76041;
Happy;
Nice and appreciating network to make use of.;

Vry good app;
This app is still alive??!! 🤯🤯🤯;
bring the hype back man all my friend stopped using this app;
so far more respectful and still fun ✊🏽;

"""Unmapped IG Error, This IG Error was not mapped to an Error Code To fix it, update the Error tool under ‘CAA’ to map it to an Error Code."" I already tried the available troubleshooting steps. I can log in via iPad OS but not on my pixel 7.";
A long way to go, but it's already a great app. Loving the vibe.;
I wish I was allowed to follow more than 7500 people🙄;
not X !;
Good App. Feels like it's still in its infancy, and I'm patient. I'm getting used to the interface but am still waiting for topic searches, hashtag usage, language translation, gif integration, etc. It handles images and video insertion well. Wish there was a way to pay for more characters per post, too. I hope they continue to build this platform. I'll stick around and find out.;
Never used it but rate it 1 star for fun;
I hope you;
Needs an edit button and a much-needed translator like Twitter. (Now stupid X!);
better than twithead;
Not Good;
"It's like, ""Just the facts, ma'am"". Less static, and the posts are more current. I prefer it over X.";
Still clunky and difficult to navigate.;
Like it.!!;
No use apk;
Bad;
Interface feels like a cheap copy.;
i want to delete it but can't cause my Instagram account will stop;
Great app. I left x long time ago.;
still needs work;
Ok, I looked at this application and see no reason for it.;
Good;
Suraj Prajapati;
Not use full for me 😞;
Ok experience. Need more features and functions. Feels a bit bland.;
Nice One 😊👌;
ok;
its hella fun. i love it;
great 😃👍 application;
Why do I need this? It opens, but nothing works. Do we have a problemo Houston?;
Must delete IG acct. to deactivate Threads. Ridiculous (no) Privacy policy.;
Best;
i have twitter account;
Add the threads badge inside option in Instagram;
"Mark, I Need You, To Change The Name To ""Twitter""";
Good project;
useless app;
Missing key features. Finding content is weak. No volume control on videos is particularly irksome. Browser version is even worse. Twitter has become a toxic wasteland. This should be one of the major contenders for those making the exodus from that cesspool, but it's not there yet. Zuck needs to step things up.;

Bekar app;
good work threads;
Still garbage! It really doesn't bring like minded folk together. I rarely see any posts I'm into from strangers for me to connect with (follow). A friend from Twitter told me she doesn't see anything on Threads of mine. They need to come up with a way to link folk. Hash tags have worked for ages, surely there's no ownership on hash tag labels? If so come up with something else and fast. Meta are trying to create a twitter overnight. They need slow down and build alongside the users joining.;
Nice app;
It keeps crashing after a few seconds Browser version is fine but you can't transfer posts to IG;
Nice aap;
Wow;
gud;
M S Babu;
Super;
Plz add save videos;
Worst app, twiter is much much better than;
Nice🙂🙂;
Total full to copy of Twitter and I know this will fail soon and you will have to close this application for ever sooner than later.;
अभी तक तो बहुत अच्छा है;
Well nice, finally added stylized icon for Android 12+. What about other apps by Meta???;
great;
Video normal;
Better than twitter;
Absolutely love ,Threads! Great stuff!;

Thank gawd there is something we can use since that unhinged narcissistic manchild bought the bird app and wrecked it. I can't wait untill my mutuals join up.;
Very good platform 👊👍💪👌👌;
please add the edit feature.. if we need to correct some spelling mistakes;
"No moderation on fake accounts that just pester you to visit their porn websites, set up false relationships or go to their chat rooms on external sites etc. Twitter/X is getting worse with these issues day by day but I've now had to block 7 accounts in the last few days, so this being ""a better alternative"" isn't showing me that. Instagram's way too lenient with these accounts so it doesn't surprise me, but doesn't take away the frustration & dissatisfaction either!";
I would improve the picture options for the header of each one's page...💯💯💯;
Nice;
Bxoiz muthoo;
Bad;
I think its cool like a little bit different from other apps no dm 🙃 so I enjoyed it more then insta & Twitter ,no political post 😅😉;
Twitter🗿 >>>>>;
it's great!;
great app enjoy💯;
Yes, it's becoming a superior Twitter. They set the bar pretty low recently, however I don't like that they couldn't give me the ability to edit my post sometime and I wanna add hash tags for correct a type of without having to remake the whole thing.;
Neat way to converse with other people.;
worst app;
this is a very good app everyone will enjoy This app is the father of Tik Tok;
interesting App but only if they can add one thing it would be a lot easier for us. a list where we can see the person that I'm following follows me back just like on insta and twitter.;
🥀💔😔;
It's a good app. I like it. You can talk to anyone but there is a problem that we can't post my pic but we can write and that's I like it. I didn't get any follow request but in Instagram I got daily 15 requests. I think Insta is best then that. You should also try the app. I think the Threads company can improve some little things that would be best. For Insta and Threads viewers. Like you have your threads and you want to check your insta then in 1 click you can go to insta there is a option.;
Jitenda yadav;
AWESOME!!! Mr. Z needs to do a tune up with small bugs but order than that is AWESOME!!!💯👍;
Shakir Rajput;
Boring;
i love threads. its way better than x and actually has a owner who listens to user feedback. good job zuck;
good;
🤙🏿👍🏿;
Best odmf in app;
More content is needed to make it a huge success. I do enjoy threads, but not enough content yet. I trust that it will grow;
👍;
this will be a great app once we can use hashtags and maybe have a pool of images and gifs ready to add;
I like this alternative to Twitter. They lost me with the name change, among other dislikes I am waiting to have more features like hashtags, ability to group users into lists, etc before downloading the app. And a more colorful logo would be nice.;
Such a boring app;
Ok;
thank you;
Nice 👍;
I find it easy to communicate on threads. 🤞;
Kj;
So butyfull app 😘😘 nice 👍 good;
interesting;
While this app is limited. The community here is awesome! Can't wait for this to become more fleshed out. I highly recommend this app over X. No, this wasn't a paid review. I am speaking from the heart.;
I feel that it has better vibes than Twitter, for which I hope Threads will continue to maintain that.;
very good app;
Nice and ok;
good;
Threads is still at the beginning stages. I am hopping it will get better, have trends etc.;
Abdul Kalam Mansuri;
Nice app, looking forward to more updates and more users.;
My only complaint is, I have two accounts under one email and on the browser I can't use one of the accounts because it only loads in the one. When I try to sign in with my email and password it says the password is wrong when it isn't, and there's no way to use that account. Works fine on my phone, not on the browser. I still haven't been able to see the browser version.;
Still think there is a ways to go to replace my use on Twitter. Main issue is how new threads are loaded. Seems like at times they load the newest first and you have to scroll down until you get to old ones. Next time it holds your place at the last read and then you scroll up to the newest which is preferred for me. Works be nice to have a settings that you can put what you like.;
early twitter vibes;
cool but updates comes late and some problems likes has not direct;
Can't delete account and it always shows on the Instagram bio.;
It's apart of instagram and Facebook. They hacked my account, nobody protected it. They just placed their hate towards me. Messed up every relationship I tried to build. I don't just blame my enemies, it's those who also allowed for it to happen. It is what it is. I never met H.E.R. some people made it seem like I was bad luck. When I got haters. So, y'all can't blame me.;
Zuckerberg needs to get rid of the very spammy links to stories. It harkens back to a time when a reader wouldn't read, knowing spam wirh all the pop-ups were coming NO THANKS. But. This forum better than the horrible Musk Twitter!;
this will take over;
Well right iff the bat I have not used it yet but thought it was nice addition to Instagram but y is it not in main app as a extra option in main app. It should be. & its data it can collect if not careful is way 2 extreme. Only use the required. No reason 4 it to know religion, acess texts to texts, which are optional but still y. & be careful not to give any optional data 4 them to collect. I know y they doing it because data is king. & algorithms will use it all to know what u want to see/buy;
Too intrusive. A security concern.;
asimyoyo;
Threads is a total left winger App, there is no middle of the road on here, I was hopeful at the beginning, yet just a bunch of total leftists screaming at everything. So sad that I have had to Delete everything on my page but 2 post because so many hatred replies 😞;
This application is so cool 😎;
Harisingh boy 100k 🙏♥️🚩;
So far so good but the app could be better! 👍 Constant improvement!;
Not useful;
Good communication app;
Not as many features as X/Twitter, but much less toxic;
👍👍😊😊😊😍😍;
A waste of space on my phone. I feel most subscribers installed it during the hype of a new social media forum; there was no information shared at release about it being locked to your insta acc. and being unable to uninstall it without repercussions to said account! 🙄🤨 I would rate it in the negatives if there were the options to! WASTE. OF. SPACE.🗑
App sucks everytime I go on home page app closes.;
This aap is very entresting 😊😊;
boring;
Not good;
no one likes me and no follows me !! it's Disgusting;
app size should under 25MB because it is text based platform.;
Jhakasssss;
I just want a true chronological order. And for my local news orgs to finally start using Threads like they do Twitter. I'm in a major city and only 2 people from all the news stations and papers post on Threads. Also, if we can post from IG to Threads like we could from IG to Twitter.;

One more piece of *** as all Meta's products! Tons of bugs and UX directly from madhouse!;
100% copy of X. And plus asks about a lot of permissions.;
as toxic as twitter 🤣;
A edit button and translation button would be nice!...;
This app is a fail. What's the point..;

super app;
nice;
It's annoying to have to keep hitting the speaker on button for every video it should be a toggle on or off like Instagram is. Once I turn sound on that means for the rest I scroll down to also..... just my intake... pretty sure y'all on it after this comment since it's pretty new, so thanks in advance;
Nice 👍🙂;
Worst;

सविनय निवेदन है की...threads k baad jo an Instagram app likha hai usko hta de..ghar walo kaa khoon khaul jata hai yeh naam sun k..;
Nice app 👌;
Loving Threads ❤️;
Bad UI;
It's still early but with a new desktop version and search it's becoming more usable.;
This app is designed to segregate the discourse of public opinion so that parasite nazis in american politics can get joe biden elected again. Stand up and say no to masks, say no to CBDCs, say no to V 4 X, say no to BRICS. If you dont know what im talking about, look it up. You will need to know because you're going to make a choice before 2030 if we're going to let the devil win and the UN takes over, killing 7 billion. Otherwise, we can help god and save 7 billion. We are being demoralized.;
Unless you actively have your phone in dark mode, there is no dark mode. Stupid. Instagram has this feature, why is it hard to implement on threads? And the app has been out for a while now. Dark mode helps my vision/migraines so it's an accessible feature to include, and it really isn't asking for much.;
nice apps;
It has many bugs;
Nice 👍;
Better than X...;
Nice app;
It's alright it keeps saying error try again later;
Sanjaydakua;
Good app. Because I need app like this not all content videos this app full of word I love it. Thanks for make it. Just one request from Me make black mode. ✌;
WHY KEEP SHOWING POSTED MEDIAS IN GALLERY & CANT EVEN DISABLE IT?! Can't even edit description & can't even drag the timer while watching a vid. Once dragged PLAY ALL OVER AGAIN FROM STARTING. can at least allow us to crop image while uploading them???;
Refreshing social media app.;
❤️;
Excellent;
mr nagarjun 01;
Just a cheap version of x.;
Just a bas copy of X;

it's ok. but I don't see a translation capability, and I can't see how many threads/posts I have.;

Don't download this app! NEVER! Its impossible to delete our threads account. To do that we have to delete our Instagram account too! Crazy!;
Would be okay if I was able to post on it.. keeps failing to post.;
didn't understand the vibe of this app yet. don't what to post! are you trying to replicate Twitter feature here?;
good luck;

how to use;

like Instagram... but more chill. like Twitter.... but more chill. this is great 👍;
excellent... and improving steadily in the right direction. well done team. please keep it up. (edit button)?;
A magnificent app, it's where I rant and talk about my problems, ngl Threads is my safe space, a vault and Threads is my everything. Thank you for building this app.;
Installed this from play store and have used it for a few weeks. Just now I started the app, got an error message and then a page saying I might have been phished and provided a link to supposedly fix it. Needless to say I did not and immediately uninstalled it. Someone has managed to hijack this app. I no longer trust it.;
the navigation has me baffled. the entire environment seems to be muted in some way. doesn't feel alive, if you get me drift.;
What's the point lol. It's dead on arrival.;
This is just a Twitter knowoff;
"Made a few reports about dangerous individuals, Instagram response was ""due to the high volume of reports we were not able to review your request"" That's exactly how dangerous individuals get to do crime using their platform, solution: Hire more people to investigate reports, why run a social Media platform if it's too overwhelming and you can't manage it properly now Thread. Lots people offering their account up for sale porn and paying $5k scams. Mark Zuckerberg stop bumming Elon Musk disgrace";
better;
"Love Threads and the great group of ""Thriends"" I follow, and follow me. ♥️";

A far less toxic social media platform than the Elongated Muskrat's equivalent.;

Much better than Twitter / X way less toxicity and more intelligent discourse.;

The worst application ever developed;
Best;
stay active and gain more, thread keep us together in one needle of love;
It's sucks;
Instagram threads apps for my working on insta;
I open the apps with ma insta account and i didn't post anything or share anything, all i did was saving some cars and anime photo that's it and after 2/3 minute ma account get disband saying i did something wrong to violate policy what's happening fix this issues please. I only download this app just 5 min ago and getting ban ? Really ?;
Soo bad;
The app is good but its missing some regular and basic features. Features like messaging are missing. They need to modernize this app if they want to compete with the best ones in the market.;
Such a bad experience. The app asked me to log out 10 mins after i installed it for the first time.;
threads is pure iterative detailed design creativity exposed in application software. Instagram desires and creators know their stuff... it's a gem of ann app if you remember to curate the people and puns you follow carefully. and jumping and engage. the early Threadsters remind me of early twitter In Toronto. I have a bias for early adopters of novel social media.;
No good, it keeps crashing.;
Profile disabled on the day of download. Rather stick to instagram.;
Good;
It's okay okay kind of app;
I'm enjoying what interaction I'm capable of doing in advancing a more positive dialogue of some truly scary things that are happening. And the trolls trying to drag me into their muck are as easy to deal with as tapping on a Block Button.;
Threads is an enjoyable social space with a lot of positive vibes and potential. The app is still growing with needed updates and improvements. not as many brands or businesses are active there now as on other networks. fun place though.;
Aap is really good but I am really fed-up that every video is muted by default and when I unmute video don't play.;
What a waist;
Bad;
Copy pasted from Twitter . Creat your own ideas;
"Was invited via Instagram to join Threads, so I did. Checked back half an hour later and discovered my account has been ""disabled for repeatedly posting material that violated their Community standards"" etc. I haven't even had a chance to post anything yet. get your act together, Threads!";
Nice i love it heheheh;
We cannot post automatically on instagram and threads at the same time. Does ot make any sense at all?;
Unbelievable..;
Love Threads .;
A trash app. It even flags your account and disables it even though you only literally posted a single thread.;

Threads disabled my account without any reason my threads were not against any guidelines why did they disabled my account I can't log in to my account pls give me back my account;
very nice and feel better app so nice;
It's a very interesting, with no frills attached app. Interesting & entertaining. Based on the feedback from elsewhere also they should update the app from time to time. Wish a bright future. Don't spoil with advertisements popping up in between. However you have to make money also. Nothing can b free. Things given free will b taken for granted & loose the shean over sometime. You know better than us, to run a show successfully. All the Very Best. Janakiraman Venkatachalam.;
It's amazing;
nice;
Ik;
This is the Blue alternative to X. My biggest issue with Threads is the Video player. Most times, I get picture with no sound. It would be nice to have a video open in the player of my choice. I get that it is still in its infancy. So we wait.;
Okay so something happened just now. I had never used Instagram nor downloaded this app. I use xiomi and you know how apps show up on the screen for a security scan after they're downloaded? That happened. I was studying and had a timer on my screen and that just popped up. I dunno how the hell this happened but I want an answer because I know for sure I did not download it and if I had, it would show up earlier but it didn't. And I was studying for like 20 mins straight. I want an answer rn.;
saddam;
Uninspiring and not at all user friendly interface. If I'm going to be frustrated, I may as well just use Xwitter.;
wish I could interact more with people here.;
Deactivated me for posting a pictures of my own cats awful app wouldn't recommend at all. Has tighter restrictions then Facebook as I don't see how posting a few pictures or videos of your own pets is breaking any rules. I would highly recommend steering clear of this pathetic app. Sensorship on steroids. Should be deleted utter waste of time!!;
It was a worst experience for me Using this app I was the 1300+ person to install this app nd it showed on my insta profile but after deleting this app nd again installing I can't get my old ID nd now I'm 200 M + Person to install this app This app is worst nd I don't like threads and instagram in one place it should be separate apps from Meta Nd Yes, It can't be the alternative of twitter;
Groo;
बहुत ही अच्छा @ threads;
I express myself more here;
Copy of Twitter. Twitter is better 🗿;
Nice..........;
is lit;
Would love to see trending news, hashtags, cash tags, bookmarks, and a feature to 'turn off' politics.;
Good application 💯;
Its very bad this is policy is not good not install this app please cheak google review 👎👎;
It's so much better than the ex-app! There are less people still, and it's still improving, but it's not a Nazi cesspool like Twitter! It has the potential to overtake Twitter if they keep the improvements coming!;
Dumbest app ever exist in play store;
it's amazing 🥳;
love this so far;
This app is good but there is some problems like as #...... I want to see # in it....thank you;
Very impressed with the paid version - the only beef is with repositioning tiles in high is a little buggy but otherwise the advantages gained from a really beautiful UI is with that little bit of struggling at times to line them up. Best launcher ever !;
Today was the first time ever tried Threads. I had signed onto it through my Instagram account, but when I wanted to change my photo profile on my new account on Threads, my phone had froze and my account on Threads was instantly banned. I received the warning on Threads saying that I had violated the terms of agreement with too many postings! That does not make sense!;
Good app to meet new person and making conversations interesting;
easy to use and devoid of far right extremists.;
Please add time and date stamp for post;
It's a pity you can't submit zero stars. Closely resembles a left wingers thought process. No consistency, confused, a weak copy of something that has been done before. I guess this was required after all the snowflakes got butthurt on X. Hopefully as more people get on it, the lefty agenda will dwindle away into forgotten history where it belongs.;
Not available in my area for like, ever 😕;
I turn to social tools to build community, people I enjoy because of shared ideas, shared careers, experiences, beliefs. Threads is getting there. Tech advances (on their part) and patience (on mine) are making my experience better and better.;
"I wish you could have your timeline be ""newest threads first"" and not just ""here's what we want you to see.""";
What's the point? This is just another Twitter clone. Like Instagram, I wonder if we will have to pay for ads just to have people see your content on here, too!;
تويتر عمك;
if you're gonna bite off of Twitter, at least have an edit button to make it worth while.;
"Was blocked from posting/liking/reposting/following/commenting for one week for ""sharing your account with a service that helps you get more followers..."" What does that even mean? Every time I tried to eg like a post, a notice popped up reminding me of the ban and asking whether I wanted to ""Tell us"" if I believed there was a mistake. I would click on ""Tell us"", but nothing ever happened & zero feedback. Extremely disappointing & unfair.";
it's missing something Idk what it is;
I love Threads;
Great 👌😊 application;
😉;
Missing a lot of features;
This might just be the very best social media.;
Good response;
Good;
Best;
love the bookish community. the app needs more features!;
It is very good app for social media service and useful for people who are very good and talented;

It's like walking into a party full of people you don't know all having private conversations that don't involve you. Then, after walking around the room a bit, you realize it was a mistake coming here, and you just want to go home;
Thanks for adding Adaptive Icon Theming support for the app icon. Hopefully more Facebook apps follow suit.;
Nice;
The air is fresh and clean in Threads, without any of that Musk-y odor!;
✌️🙂👍;
Stupid copy of Twitter. Joined with much expectations buh it has almost frustrated us. Messange service to be added. trending things are to be shown or else it will continue slowing down;
Nice app;
Very good 👍;
I love this , this is very amazing;
it's Musk free;
much nicer environment than X;
Nice;
📸✨❤️;
Prma NahaN;
good app;
If you want to see random posts from people you don't know or care about then this is the app for you;
Knttt app;
nice looking 😍;
No new features are added into the social platform like enabling hashtags;
not better than X for the topic and thread post;
پلتفرم خوبیه ولی خب به پای توییتر نمیرسه;
so far so good.;
total waste;
Booming in the beginning, And getting boring right now;
Nice app ❤️👑;
Okay 👍👌👍 good 😊;
Keep stopping;
NICE App;
One Of The Best Application ❤️;
happy;

Worst;
Feels great,just like Twitter;
It seems to be a great platform and fast pace, comparing it to the other three platforms I'm on. I'm really enjoying it 😌 ☺️ 😊.;
it needs to get better. why is getting verification taking so long .;

Nice app;
Basic but the best x replacement t to date.;
Yay;
Good;
It's not interesting now;
👍👍👍;
Nice;

very good app;
A feed that I could personally customize would make this app five stars.;
I love this app is very easy to use and you can share you way of think, no matter if you've used before a similar app, you can open the app and start to use it is very intuitive. Other thing that I like this app is more moderate, you can scroll down and don't found adult contain for mistake, you only read what you follow. This app in my opinion is better than X, I used Twitter (X) for many years ago, but now I feel repetitive in Threads you can grow your account only with you contain.;
Kapil_rao_sahab_009;
love the app, my only beef is I miss my # hashtags;
Very bad experience...;
easy to use... so far so good;
Nice;
Berry good this app;
Just started Using this........E never dey sweet Me@#$%&;
This aap not good but middle good;
message not send each other;
there is no reach of my post. it should increase the reach of my post though itself.;
it's twitter;
Like comment share please;
I still can't access the web version, and it needs a trending.;
2M followers;
super;
la mejor option a Twitter que ya no existe, sin publicidad y sin tanto hate;
No hashtags makes ot difficult to reach people about various topics. if this is to be a true competitor to X, than this site needs more functions.;
It's getting there, features are rolling out, privacy could be better. Just gotta be patient.;
nice app;
it has potential;
not upto mark;
இது நல்லாவே இல்ல 🤌🏽;
For phone good but how the heck do I find Threads for desktop? I'm told it exists but am having no luck finding it. Tried via here (Google Play) but no go.;
Nice 👍;
Bakwas h;
Can't delete threads account;
Blocking a search for Covid posts is Not cool.;
Way better than the X;
it is nice and easy to use..thanks;
I don't get it...is it twitter or a slimmer version of Instagram?! What's the point?;
Good app, thanks 🤝;
Better than X;
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜;

Threads has search, a night mode, news. it doesn't have $8 blue check promoted mediocre minds boring me, limits on scrolling & most importantly a Billionaire owner who thinks it's funny to p*ss off his customers. I'll be here forever. Thanks Threads!;
except for crashing;

Nice app but it would be nice to have a tab that has the Threads and Reposts altogether.;
Excellent;
I like it;
so much exited;

Great app,but lets be honest the logo of the app is 666,look at it well;
do not go anywhere near it, is working girls, fake underage children from asia, and meta refuse to do anything about it, another failed app from meta. it is just a spam bot, all messages are spam as they go to the whole world, you have no control, so get spammed by the world, no one is talking to friend or family, total waste of space, very cleary about the fee for the tick fee, another scam from mark, which has failed and killed the world .;
Dada lankesh 05 Instagram ID;
Epic.;
Not seeing its purpose if I'm honest. What's its role. Its like I'm on Instagram, but with missing features? Not being negative for the sake of it. Just not seeing its use?;
although I'm thoroughly enjoying the positive engagement, there's just not enough features.;
Very bad apps;
Good app. Still waiting for the search topics feature and edit button;
Following feed still shows people that I don't follow. If it were follows' follows or liked by follows, it would at least make sense, but it really should be direct follows only.;
Still needs a lot of functionality, like hashtags and search features, but at least it's not a nazi cesspool like X has become.;
It was good😑😑😑;
Good;
Really helpful;
Great;
Good ✨️👍🏻;
Let's be honest no one uses this;
App won't let me sign in.;
boring;
You can't delete yr account and data, i don't feel it is safe at all;
Useless one;
follow me;
Bad algorithms so you mostly see random people it thinks are ideologically aligned talking to themselves. Feature poor. lots of people sharing screenshots of popular tweets to no one in particular. We should all quit social media together and the companies are helping by ignoring what made them popular to begin with.;
I enjoy the way I can add onto my post and create a story based on my original post.;
How long will we continue waiting to use hashtags?;
super the app;
خلونا نعرف نغير الاسم بدون ما يتغير عالانستا لو سمحت + شكرا لانه حلو اي لايك ات;

Wonderful;
no need of this app. i think Instagram is enough.;
No ok;

thread is more interesting than Instagram and Facebook;

It's a great app, but if you haven't logged into it for more than 2 days, your followers decrease.;

Nothing new to experience there. App uninstalled successful 🚮;
It's not allowing me to post a thread , threads is not aval to everyone 😤;
I love Threads! I've not had any issues with the app. I left Twitter (X) 3 years ago and haven't looked back.;
💗 just 🔥 💯;
Thank you duplicate Twitter app;
it's useless when we have twitter, they should focus on bringing what twitter doesn't have.;
very basic. hope to see improvement.;
I like the app. It's easy and fun to use and no glitches for me. It could use more options and the stalkery permissions are against human rights, but other than that I like it. it's a good transition from Twitter.;
One of my favourite social platform;
Nyc;
Rahul. Sain;
Not really sure what is the point of this app? It functions exactly the same as Instagram. You follow people and reply / like their posts and pictures. What's the main draw to this app?;
Nice app for you Avery One day injoy tu some time always gist;

This app is the worst version of Twitter, the only thing Lark Lukerberg knows is copy paste from other apps. Twitter is way ahead of this trash copy paste app.;
Great app, but the restrictions are too much;
What nonsense app...;
amazing 👏🏻 love it ❤️😊;

Threads an Instagram;
Amazing 😍😍;
Nice;

Threads was SOOO hot 🔥 for like 2 days. Then we all went back to our regularly scheduled life;

"it is time to make clear: A. do ""i"" believe in the US Constitution or B. should we chuck-it and ""see what happens"" there is a fork in the road...";
Yes. You are already downloaded on this app device.;
This app needs a whole lot of work.;
Imagine;
it's good;
It's a so boring to use and same like X and yours Instagram Worst experience 🤮;

Throw this app into the garbage. It doesn't work!!!;

Very nice;
Bruhhh a 69th copy of twitter...;

plz update tha threads;
Loving this 😍 All the features of similar apps without all the hate and harmful rhetoric. Thank you.;
Great platform, but for some reason, the first time I installed it on my tablet, for some reason, Google Play installed Truth Social instead of Threads!;

Will get five stars once there are direct messages.;
My post keep failing to be uploaded, especially post with pictures. And its so annoying, please fix that;
better than X lmao;

Why do I need to install this app to set up a profile that could just as easily be provided via the web site? First thing it does after I finish is hit me with a bunch of useless accounts which I end up blocking? Requiring an Instagram account is even stupider.;
the actual threaded conversations are confusing and poorly designed. I can never see my original comments or replies, so it's difficult to follow any conversation that is replied to. I have no idea what they are replying to. I would categorize the organization of a thread as developed by someone inept and void of tech skills.;
Good place for Truth and Facts...not a lot of crazy, hating people here👍;
99% lib or COMMUNIST dems, HATERS On this Site...Weirdest, Strange, Not Your Normal Type Human Beings. Posts Make No Sense... One STRANGE Site..;
Uselessss;
We need editing button. We can't see viewers on our videos, why?;
kindness is cool again on this site;
khan 💕💞💕;
It needs a feature to switch accounts like instagram for people with multiple handles, or if it does have such a feature already, it ends to be more accessible. Outside of that it looks promising 😁;
Best 👌;
Hope the next update has translate option😌;
as long as its free;
No point. The whole purpose of this app is to interact more closely with those people you want to follow, but so few people are actually using this. Then almost every single post shown to me is an account I don't follow or a topic that I'm not interested in. It literally doesn't accomplish the goal it's setting out to do. Download more;
👍;
Off to a good start.;
Got 2 words for you. Zuck It.;
Worst app;
need hash tags to find trending stories.;
Nice work 😀;
Nice 👍;
Like it;
twitter but not evil;
Why you are copy from X;
Sunil;
with new features being added its a better platform than the ex-bird app;
You name it, Threads has it. Couldn't ask for better platform. It's regulated just enough to keep harassment and unhealthy elements down. It keeps racism and hate speech to a minimum.;
🥰🥰🥰;
Anuraj ❤Keshri;
meri videos publicaly show kyu nhi ho rahi hai. na koi views;
Excellent;
Good 👍;
9/10 Recommend for User of X(Twitter). But you need Instagram Account.;
Fine experience;
It is a safe platform to discuss and share views.;
I just started using this app, I think I had it downloaded but I never used it lol, but. now I am obsessed and it's on my home screen so it's a big deal.;

Invasive and dangerous, but hey, at least we'll be entertained while civilization collapses i am so glad I found out (before I made an account) that the only way to get rid of threads is to delete your Instagram as well.;
Failed to upload problems for every users. Bad.;

Cannot use hashtags, I'm struggling to figure out how to reach a particular audience;

Unistalled.. couldn't see people's comments on threads.. I also couldn't post. I could at the beginning but then it wouldn't let me. I did contact them and surprise surprise, no response.;
Great positivity and awesome app;
Very bad;
super;
Need to allow edits.;
Kya Bh;
we need to bring back our badge!!!!!!!@;
"suddenly the ""following"" threads are random people I don't follow. I can even find the people I DO follow. this option used to work. what happened????";
3* for now, way more positive place than Twitter and has the foundations to be everything Twitter could have been. Will immediately bump to 4* when #s get implemented to find communities easier!;
Very nice;
Overall the app is nice, still needs some improvements. Please add some animations on your pics and videos when we scroll them down after watching, and it would've been nice if this app was integrated with insta, switching apps is a bit redundant🤕.;
please like comment;
engagement is not so good;
Clap if you care! Clap if you CARE!!;
I will delete thread so my account is deleted;
absolutely loving Threads and the way it integrates with my Instagram account.;
helpful app;
Don't appear to be able to use without Instagram account;
good;
Love this app;
"So I'm guessing after failure to fight tik toj now you try to be a better Twitter? I doubt that anything connected to Instagram Facebook meta can be good. Elon musk vs mark Zuckerberg. So bad and worse or lesser evil? Facebook trying to be a dating app Instagram connected to Sim swapping and big data leaks. Meta dirty fight against tik toj. Nah I don't think this is going to work. I think for now it's really low chance. And,, Twitter of old"" you guys mean in hands of government agency a toy?";
Trash.......Cheap twitter clone😐;
Useless app;
Less hate, better people. Wish y'all allowed hashtags though.;
VVIP;
Since adding a Following/For You option, and NO ADS?!, this app now beats Twitter by a mile. Love it.;
I love this app but it's still young. Needs a little work yet but I really enjoy it!;
I like it so far, but they really need to get #hashtags working.;
GOOD;

Yes I about say that someone is else this like app;
Needs a DM option.;
This is stupid;
My account was recently temporary suspended because of my personal opinions were not appreciated by another user. It would have been nice if Threads investigated prior to suspended an account. Just goes show your automatically found guilty before their investigated. Users beware that anyone can be suspended.;
Me encantó;
it's a far better alternative to the dumpster fire 🔥 cesspool that Twitter has become. need for features but I know that will be in the works in the near future. 👍🏿;
I accidentally hid my batch number now I can't unhide it, kindly make some sorta access to that for influencers!!!;
doesn't seem like there is much going on.and I can never tell if my threads actually are posted;
It takes a bit of getting used to.;
Easy to use, great content, love it!;
At first I thought it was very useful, but now it seems that it is not very useful. It might be okay for kids;
0 stars for this app, it's horrible. you have inappropriate images and women doing inappropriate things... and many men writing to very young women... very bad;
Joyful and interesting.;
It's so refreshing to use a platform that improves features and fixes issues with out requiring hand outs.;
High Res pics, no need to use a 3rd party app to crop them, can upload 10 at a time. I like it a lot but needs a little improvements like seeing only ppl I follow in my feed, keywords or hashtags for searching content...;
Great App, soon it will offer everything that that other app does except it doesn't have that arrogant, self centered juvenile rich man thats has ever lived running the show;
we need # and search!;
Prashant Kumar Singh;
Threads is a mess.;
good app , still needs a couple of items for a 5 star from me , it needs lists so I can see the folks I interact with the most, also a buffer when you enter threads from when you left instead of updating the moment you reopen it . It has a lot of good folks on it , much better than the bird app.;
Nice 👌😁;
Twitter is much better;
Been, a long time coming ! Keep up the good work !;
Add download option too;
Nice;
Lofar aap;
Let's migrate from X (formerly Twitter) to Threads everyone!;
🔥 🔥;
it's all like a reboot of its ancestors. a better version of 2 popular medias.;
Super 👍🥰👍🥰👍🥰🥰👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍;
very nice;
Copycat;
Still has a ways to go, but beats the cesspool of Twitter/X.;
Oh Nice;
🥰🥰;
was liking it but can't add the badge back on my ig profile :/;
Needs a lot more work.;
bohot achha hai;
It will be better if they give posts to save or download. It is missing currently in this version.;
the best option to the old app, hands down;
I love this app;
Nice;
Osm;
Mice;

The problem is, for me, you have to own or use your Instagram account to sign up for this app. At least, make a choice where u can use your instagram account or only email to sign up for new account.;
its getting there. needs dms still. missing core features;
Could be less of Twitter IG;
Nice;
no offensive tweets;
عالی👌👍;
I can't post. Every time I try it says failed to upload post;
Best of luck 🍀;
Good;
Often failed to upload new threads. Lots of glitch when trying to view videos. Twitter still better...;
It helps for sharing content, as well as networking with others. I enjoy learning about others in my field of author of children books.;
good;

This app takes very long to download and also it is not suitable to be used on a tablet too. Not really convenient.;
Better than the other place and run by a guy who (unlike the other guy) actually knows what he's doing.;
bad;
not quite used to it yet..def not giving up Instagram!;

not enjoying it, too many restrictions, u follow friends, restrictions, u like a post restriction.i can't post on anybody's post since God knows when. presently I can't follow, can't like and can't comment. what am I then doing in thread? it's frustrating!!!;
Nice;
Great apps;
almost like twitter;
Worst app I have ever used Don't download it;
pretty good;
I'm trying it Out instead Of Using Twitter Heard Talks About it On The News.;

Not too bad so far. Managed to avoid racists and misogynists here, so that's good. Only wish the refreshing for new posts actually provided new posts. Seems to refresh every few hours with new posts, but like I'm suuuuper sure more people are posting beyond that.;
It's a nice app but there's some work to be done;
don't worry the only thing is that;
Very little interaction so far. May take off if Twitter starts charging;
nahi;
Nice;
Awful app and cheap copy of X;
What the app formerly known as Twitter, could have, should have been. I have found my tribe!;
Nice one;

"There are no sounds for notifications, nor is there a read indicator to let one know if & when their thread post(s) have even been read. It would be quite nice to maybe see a color customizer integrated into threads, in order to make the thread experience more individual & personable. Other than these minor issues; the cleanliness & ease of use is unmatched👌🏼Thanks Threads🤗";
excellent community;
Rubbish !!;
Like the app but RTL languages seems to tip over to the profile pic and lose a couple of letters;

Why don't my threads show up on Instagram profile;
It's just a second Instagram, full of videos with less content in text, you were wrong to compare it to Twitter 🚮🚮;
I experience lags very often, but it’s a great app. I like it. I hope they can fix the problem.;
A good form of chain reaction of opinions;
Good appo;
trend 📉 it the same time zone ads;
Good;
it's getting better now that they added an option to search for topics.;
Superb!;
threads app💖;
I came here after Elon Musk destroyed Twitter, and find it a far better experience.;
Takes a bit of getting use to, but it is way better than T.....r or x;
😍 😍 😍 😍;
While it had a lot of initial interest, I'm weary of how bad the ads are going to be if Facebook is any indication. It lacks a lot of personalization options like colors, font sizes, banner images, or other settings available in competitors like Xwitter, but is at least stable and easy to navigate. Definitely a more complete experience using the app than trying to use the web verson.;
You need threads it's a must have!;
Emoo 🖤;
Needs Improvement. Just having followers and following isn't enough. When you open someone's profile if we are following each other, we should be able to see 'follows you' (the person following me) and following signifying I'm following the person.;
it's a fun place to post random thoughts, but it has limited features: you can post images, videos, or text and you can see other posts and recommended account's posts, but that's it. if there was more to do it would be better, but I still like it!;
I really really love this app, but am disappointed with one thing, you can't chat privately....;
dull content. confusing timeline. no hashtags to foster community during bonding events such as GP races or even elections. It's the Lada Niva of social media apps. You'll get from A to B, but you're not sure how, and no one will want to come with you.;
Had to delete. The app messed up my Instagram. Now I can't upload photos to IG. This happened after I tried to add a story from Threads and add to Instagram at the same time. Now everytime I try to add a picture to IG stories,reels or feed is says error or unable to save image. Even after I cleared cache, cleared data, uninstall and re installed IG. Wish I never added Threads;
I'm on Threads all the time now, I'm barely on Instagram anymore. I love the community!;
Nice;
I hope you have some real time speech like Twitter.;
Confused permeable;
nice app;
I love that you can post text, photos, or videos. You can enhance your connection with your followers with every thread you post. All that's missing for me is a DM section. Hope we get that soon.;
civilized haven of polite and friendly discussion!;
"Almost there. One issue for me that requires a fix, is the appearance of day old threads in my ""following"" tab after I refresh🙏";
Mmm;
I'm getting way too addicted to these threads,;
"I like it! It's not as jam packed as Instagram... Yet-- But until that day comes I'll enjoy the ""Sunday morning"" pace Threads possesses ♡";
So much better than twitter!;
good;
Very bad app in this world anyone rating 1 kro;

just wow, there is something fresh and the design of application is creative.;
nice 👍;
At long last, an Elon alternative;
why do we still not have hashtags?;
nice 👍👍;
It's getting better all the time.;
Last update messed up my 'following' posts, they're often in a random order, include posts from people I don't follow and miss out posts from people that I do. Hope the next update fixes it! A much nicer social space than the site than shan't be named, still a work in progress but I really hope Threads is successful in the long run.;

I don't use this app somebody ask about this app i can decided to download this app about this app i have no experience when i use this app than i will take grades to this app;
Addition of trends etc will improve the app.;
Please improve the graphics of this app and improve watching videos and also improve the forward mode on video's. Keep working day and night and make this app world best social media app. (“Keep It Up” & “Never Give Up”) 😎;
yay!! Bullocks on Elon Musk!!;
Nice app;
Very not good 😂😂😂😂;
better than the other place but hashtags would be handy;
One more piece of piece from Meta. Maybe you'd better focus on correct work and comfortable usage of your old apps?;
i love you;

It's not uploading the pictures or it's taking forever to upload them! Fix this!;
This is a very bad app. Because it follows tweet content. So I am deleting this;
BRING BACK MESSENGER LITE. Or at least give us another app that's also facebook messenger!!! I need to open my other acc the same time because I have two FB accounts for school and for personal use. I can't monitor both if only one is open!!!! BRING BACK MESSENGER LITE!!!!!!;
intresting;
nice;
that copies twitter HHHAHHAAHAH;
Not quit sure what tread means! Could someone please elaborate!!;
I wish you get better timeline scrolling. I don't want the most recent threads at the top. I want to scroll to the top to get there. Fix it;
Great way of spreading positivity and wisdom with the world 🌎;
Good;
give me followers please help me;
Better then Twitter. Video any. Time volume button. Please fix this problem.;

New brand...same jam.;
I'm really enjoying the app! It's a work in progress but new features are added fairly often. For me it's much better than the dead bird... I closed that account a couple of months ago. Never really used it except to get some of my news anyway. 👍 Thanks;
This has been a treat.;
good;
It's bad and boring;
A relief to get away from the hate on X after Musk turned off all control. Threads is much more civilised although needs tweaking a bit but improvements keep coming.;
where are my clickable hashtags and top 20 trending hashtags?;
Good;
App feels like Instagram emulating Twitter. Hope it gets better in the future but as of now, there isn't enough content that would have a Twitter user switch.;
Good experience but why does it lack dark mode coz some of us need it dark and it's cool in dark too..otherwise gud app;

the app is constantly improving, and there are currently way less crazy people on here than there are at Twitter/X;
absolutely loving it;
I think I like this one;
so good;
Work in progress. Really needs to rediscover that early momentum if it's going to become the new Twitter, especially if Musk introduces a fee for his battered toy.;
Nice 👍;
It's like Twitter, but less dumb and less racist.;
On Instagram, I can choose the option of using dark mode. Why can't I do that with this app?;
This app is very important in Instagram;
A little feedback here, you should give the option to post publicly or just to close friends kind of like on Instagram. I know twitter has posting to circle option. It would be nice to have. I spoke too soon. Twitter is getting rid of circles so maybe it's your chance to add the close friends option and get more ppl over here. Add it.;
I don't like this app. But that's just my personal preference. I feel like all of social media isn't what it used to be.;
still some way to go but it's a much better place than X;
Excellent, need verification too;
Please add the private Message Button button 🔘 nd hashtags feature as well .;
Update: the new search functionality makes it a much better app. It's developing well and needs a few more upgrades to hit 5/5.;
It's getting there feature by feature. Still better than Xitter.;
much better than the hate-filled X. Which came from the top down. I would like to see more diverse civil discussions.;
such a peaceful place to interact with others. The total opposite from Instagram. Please keep the app this way. 🙏🏿;
Very bad experience for using this app....I can't upload any threads and no solution provided the team of threads after many msg of help centre corner 😕;
Fantastic app;

Ok;
Excellent;
this is much better than that old platform.;
nice;
it would be better if you could sort your feed by chronological order rather than it being promoted;
Love the app, easy to use.. some features are missing, but it's getting better with every update.. will review again down the road.;
Best;
Not sure;
better then twitter/X at this point less drama and can't stand the toxicity on Twitter. Definitely would recommend threads and facebook at this point. Even though some things threads lacks it will get there;
It has a future. Might be the competitor that can take down the prominent site but it needs more features and adjustment to be marketable.;
love it;
Meta would block all your accounts without giving any reason. Support unreachable. Data gone. Better avoid using any Meta products.;
Excellent performance 💯👏 i;
needs an edit option;
It's really fun and easy to follow friends from instagram. Needs hashtags though;
very great;
full of advices and full of perspective so that's why I love to use this app;

Update the app already 🗣️📣;
The app will not allow any further to the sender and is no more then the service will be a bit more then a refund will get paid for by you guys as well as your own personal email and I don't need any more of your work email address or email me with your contact details to contact us for further;

I taught I was really going to enjoy and like this app because it was made by the owners of Instagram, but I don't like it at all .it has very low quality .it takes very long to post a thread;
Does not yet have the all the features of X us users liked....but its getting there. So come on in....the waters lovely and its really friendly;
Fantastic for Twitter lovers;
A decent app. It just needs a few tweeks in order for it to be my go to social media app. For starts a trending section would be amazing to see what everyone is talking about etc.;

The one thing Winston didn't forsee is the invention the mobile phone & technology associate with that ! Brilliant read! No thanks Threads! Read more books while you can, before it becomes a crime to write or read for that matter!;

I like that it is dark mode. Even I can figure out how to post on this app. 🤷 I reckon it could allow a few more words per post because I tend to ramble on a bit at times, but I suppose there has to be a limit. Anyway, I can do a mention on the previous post so I can dribble on some more. A sneaky work around. 😏;

Still a bad app.;
It's way different then Facebook or ( X ) formally Twitter. The world continues to get smaller every year. Stay informed and Question Everything 🤔....;
Nice;
Very poor;
Threads is now better than X, in my opinion.;
Advantages of peer to peer interaction, and communication associations between us is great, but I feel it could be too complicated to sustain in the future. It would be best to put your account in a comfortable tone before leaving it dormant if chosen to do so, assuming the connections continue to hold current in the background.;

Has great potential. Once trending topic is installed this app will gain more traction. If they don't add that feature, the will still be ok.;

Hey Meta, stop pushing this garbage in my Insta stream. I tried Threads, found it okay but a useless rehash of Twitter (now, stupidly called X). However, I've now hate it since you are spamming me to use this.;
the following timeline is gone when the people i follow doesn't post any update, so they suggest post from stranger That is stupid, social media is used to connect between my friends online not some stupid random post, give back the control to us;

"all this app ever does is CRASH & even when it's ""functional"", it's essentially useless without being able to search for relevant content! since the #1 best thing about TWITTER is the ability to search for every tweet ever containing specific keywords & within a certain time period, it's ridiculous that no other social media platform has included that same thorough method ~yet.. tho many still at least use hashtags lol but not Threads! couldn't even include THAT before going live, really? sigh..";
The link between accounts means if Meta's flawed automated systems find one of your accounts problematic they throttle you across the board. Way too much effort to figure out what is and isn't going to raise their flags, and it's impossible to properly appeal things when it gets it wrong. The sheer volume of posts Instagram flagged as sexually inappropriate when it's literally just a shirtless man. And then the linked threads account becomes a void you scream into. Too much drama.;
Great 😃;
Copycat #twitter;

Pleasingly filled with thoughtful posts and coherent comments. So far free of hate filled troglodytes and the random use of capital letters.;
love it 😀;
Nice app;
It's been good;
It works well, and seems to have decent moderation. I am enjoying using Threads, and really like the community gathering here. Lot's of thoughts, ideas, and opinions. Oh and cats, can't have anything without cats involved.;
Good 👍;
Not very good but not very bad 😔;
It's too amazing app;
Charan sai;
Genuinely awful. The worst social media platform on the market right now, and that's saying something — because it's got a lot of really bad competition.;
great;
Ok app but Meta didn't build this from the ground up to compete against Twitter (X). The Ui is basic and there's no way to know what's trending in the country. Missing several key features and no way to track hashtags.;
👌👌;
Good experience 😁;

guys please 👍 follow me on Instagram thread;
it helps me to let my feelings out because none of my close ones are out here;
because of threads Instagram became a bug app. can't even upload posts, reels anything on Instagram.;
I love this app more than X but it keeps stopping i don't know why, fix it and i change my review;
This app is so easy to use and has helped me to connect with other creatives in a way that I can't on Instagram.;
Great app so far. I strongly suggest adding an explore page as well as having the for you front page, and maybe fixing hashtags on Instagram and implementing them here too.;
good app;
Although it can use a few new features and upgrades, I like Threads and I believe it will improve with greatness over time. People say Threads can't compete with X, but that's not what I feel. I believe Threads will thrive and blossom on its own.;
it is good but it's missing more people;
😉;
i like this app;
amazing app!;
Blocking Canadian content. Uninstalled. Never really used it much anyways. Twitter wasn't that great, and now it's dead. Threads is just like how Twitter was, but there's no desktop browser app, so that makes it worse imo.;
very nice app;
This app is great, but like Twitter, please add the impression item next to the posts we make so that I can see how many views and impressions each post has received, except for likes and comments. This is really effective and gives more motivation to users to increase their activity time in this program and attract more audience to it. Be sure to do the new update so that you have helped both users and your application a lot ♥️;
stell need same updates;

A glitch in my profile page. I had to reinstall it becausey progile page is not loading I wish they would also include the reposts in the main posts instead of a separate column. It just doesn't make sense.;
Good app;
Hi! Kindly help my account, I've been receiving a report from my followers that they can't see my replies in Threads. it stop it after I posted 81 replies in one post. is there any limit with it or is there a bug with my account? I tried to report a problem. Hope this can be notice. Thank you.;

well the app is quite good but I suggest the app becomes more independent and it should include where u can chart someone privately just like twitter or Instagram but it's own chat box or messenger should be unique and outstanding that's why am not giving it five stars..;
Nice app bro ☺️👍;
Superior community here! Anxious to see a more fleshed out feature set.;

This app is dead fr💀;
not adding interesting features fast enough, they could seriously capitalize on the insta & threads surface area with new interesting ways to interact with homies but it kinda just isn't hitting and I hope they can turn this project around. you also need way more tools and info so creators can still feel confident they will have an audience otherwise they will never stop using X and their followers will also never stop using X thanks for coming to my Ted talk;
super;
👍✅;
incorporate direct message and other features as soon as possible. You are taking too long.;
with following;
Please bring this feature of privacy to hide certain someones whom we don't want to give the permission to see our thread post if we want.;
Threads is boring;
perfect easy intelligence smart Instagram threads app⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️;
👎👎👎👎;
Worst app;
I joined Day 1 and it's been an exciting experience from the start. Different vibe, shorter content, and mostly good people.;
Good app privacy;
X is far better;
Like Twitter, but with no porn.;
it's rather... quiet. that's not necessarily a bad thing, however I feel it's more of a broadcast at me and less conversation;
Well better than that other place like 👍;
new to this app;
Would give it 5 stars if it had a straight chronological timeline;
Not even sure why this exists.;
I love it;
great app👍;
Love the app, but lately, it restricts my posts. Pictures of my rescue horses, dogs, and cats.;
Better than X,...or Twitter,... or whatever the Muskrat is calling his brainchild today...come join the fun!;
Still needs a few features, but it's far from a garbage fire.;
I am getting notifications that I never consented for that someone has made a new post on threads and I cannot simply turn the notifications off. It rather prompts me to this page. I regret making a stupid account here. 🙃;
Better than X;
I tried to post a joke and it told me it was too similar to posts that had been flagged. I can't post vulgar hilarious jokes? Why would I even be here?;
good...;
freaking awesome! A place where truth, honesty, and genuine debates and ideas can be shared. Love it!;
Worst app ever. Twitter wannabe;
why won't it let me follow people? if I'm doing something wrong, why am I not notified?;
it's ok, they just need to fix the Trending/Search functionality and this will be the perfect Twitter replacement;

I don't fine this app useful, yes it's so user-centered, but this is incomparable to how Twitter made some informative features such as Trends, community, and the most unbeatable one: tweets searching is available. Meanwhile Threads, so far, is not providing us useful information from other users especially if we only have small number of followings and For You page is not even helpful to discover our likings, which is not how I expected it to be.;
No good;
Similar to Instagram;
great app;

Still missing a few things that will make this app a lot better. But these limits on certain things you can do is making me want to leave the app. Make it easier to see who's not following you back. And include hashtags.;

"Threads is just surviving now, a lot of the initial interest has died off and it's now about ""active"" accounts but without the actual engagement that X has. A lot of missed boats are the cause. For example, keyword search should have been rolled out from day 1!";

Once activated, you can't delete Thread without deleting Instagram account. That's total enforcement! Where's my freedom of choice?!;

...have the same complaints as most people since we are all expecting it to be as equal to twitter. But overall its a fun app to use and i'm patiently waiting for it to update. Only real compalint i have so far is videos with sound. Some videos will completely freeze if its unmuted it.;
Very poor experience Pics post always 16:9 ratio it's wrong please customised size such as Instagram and providing call and chat options. When treads better than Twitter otherswise Twitter always best.;

updated to 3 stars since the app updates ( from 1 star ) may of the fakes and scam profiles seem to be less. lots of tweaks still needed. like an edit option, an expand button so one can expand the thread if the original poster added to post at time of posting - without having to open the post separately.;

Good start. Still lags regularly. No DMs. If I don't go back to my main timing, when I click on a notification it takes me to whatever post I had open instead of the new one. Not easy to determine who follows back. I know there is more but all I can think of right now.;

Every time i scrolls down someone profile to see their threads the page automatically swipes to replies, and when back to their threads the page always back on top of their threads and repeats Its annoying Please fix this up or will uninstall this app;

Threads seems to be the most reliable way to comment on actual conversations.;
"It's pretty glitchy, not going to lie. I'm going to uninstall it for now because it keeps saying ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try again later"" no matter what i did, it just would not work, so I can't even use it anyways, what the point of using up storage space. I like the idea though, it's just too early. Edit: change to 1 star because I reported this problem so often and my threads STILL does not work. It's been how long now??";

The developers have already said that this app is a work in progress. Let's hope it gets better than Twitter and simplifies text based posts. At the current stage, the user interface is easy and beautiful. A lot of famous Twitter profiles have already moved to Threads, so it's not lonely here. The biggest issue is that you see posts from accounts that you never followed! It's very very annoying. Apart from that, this app should integrate WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram in one place.;
it's good, but there are a few glitches that need attention.;

Left wing Truth Social 🤷;
pretty low brow , some posters are similar to spam - repetitiveness and/or think communism is equal to fascism . No comment or post EDIT function . 500 word limit not adequate.

Nothing new, same as Twitter - X;

Aplikasi ini sebenarnya bagus karena mengikuti konsep yang dibangun twitter, namun dengan gaya yang berbeda. Aplikasi ini tidak bisa memberi dampak followers secara signifikan layaknya twitter. Terus trending juga tidak ada sehingga tidak tahu apa yang terjadi di dunia luas, tapi versi THREADS. Konsep yang bagus, tapi masih kalah jauh sama Twitter.;

If you loved the old Twitter, and miss it, you will LOVE Threads. it's much better, and very easy to use and understand. it's truly great!!;
perfect choice to speak freely;
i think this is a great app for me lol you know bc I have multiple personalities;
Needs a manual Dark Mode;
great app with such ease. unlike the X platform 👎;
Getting better;
can't figure out where my posts are;
easy to use;
love Threads so far! much healthier discourse than the platform that shall not be named;
can't edit posts;
I feel at home here;
Wish i could uninstall this app without having my instagram removed too;
Please update this app After opening screen wos blurred and unclear Many bug to fix your in your app;
super;
I like it 😁;
A much happier place to land than most SM - much less snark- but it still doesn't have the same conversational feel that the Bird used to have and it keeps changing my Home setting from Following to For You.;

I would like to see: 1. faster processing of the app. At present, it takes a lot of time to process a post but has improved. 2. I would like to know what other benefits to get after buying the verification tick. 3. Can the threads/interractions of mutuals be grouped together? for instance when Mark likes a thread, I get to see it, and we aren't following each other. Thank you.;

Love Threads! 4 stars because we need a trending option. Then it will be perfect!;
No visibility for my posts at all. All I see are posts from celebrities or folks with huge numbers of followers.;
good apps;

Make a light version like insta& fb;
What I don't like is the difficulty to copy and paste. Jumpy and repositions.;
give us hash tags and trend table;
Absolutely trash.. 🤢🤧;
Worst app trust me don't waste your time and give your data;
Good;
Very nice 👍👍 thanks;
It's a wonderful app just like X (formerly known as Twitter), but there's something I've noticed, there's no option to send someone a direct message. Apart from that every other thing is okay being that is still a new app.;

I've used many of the alternatives, and I choose this. Threads is friendly and fun so far, even when discussing hard things. Hoping it stays that way, and loving the people I've met so far.;
I was super excited to try Threads but i was super disappointed with it. My feed was just full of suggested post of people & things that didn't interest me & that i didn't follow. Hard to find the people i did follow. plus i can't search topic's. I'VE NOW DELETE APP. 😥;
This App is stink;
It's been a nice experience so far. I appreciate the addition of a chronological timeline and the For You timeline being more reflective of people I follow. But it still NEEDS A DARK MODE;
garbage;
Yeah this app failed;
❤️;
It's Good 😊;
Good app and platform but would be nice to have and use hashtags!.;
Not receiving any response for any issues;
Great keep it up;
Way better than X. Needs a trending tab but I'm sure they're working on it;
I like it;
You want to beat Twitter? Then allow nsfw content, its one of the reasons why people use twitter and not allowing it will decrease the chances of success by a lot.;
Amazing app!!!!!;
time waste;
nice;
brilliant hard works from you all very best to you all nothings is easy in to the future.;
This app is too woke. If you are not a liberal don't even bother they will censor you and allow dissent from others that have blocked you. Better to stick with X or truth social.;

I've been trying to give it a try or two but 🤷‍♂️,...it's really not my cup of tea I may re-download it in the future but as is, it's just not as smooth as other similar apps;

It's so much better than X because of its users. People collectively admonish vitriol and try to keep conversations civil. Threads continues to make improvements, too.;

hi sir good 💯💯;
This is the worst app I have ever used in my life. It's trying so hard to copy Twitter but failing as it doesn't have free speech and is a bit gay. Twitter is a much better app imo.;

Super Application. Download Please 🙏;
Nice Working app thank you for threads an Instagram Fimaly ❤️🙏;
as a Twitter type app (post pictures and videos) is okay but only as interesting as the people you follow.;
awesome;
Ok;
So far I like it! It's very basic and I'm kinda disappointed at the lack of accessibility options such as being able to add alt text but... Overall it has a nostalgic vibe like when social media used to be fun, at least it is for me. Interested to see how it progresses. Update - we have alt text now!;
This app needs one thing: Post Editing. That would set it apart from Twitter.;
Summa ethipathen nalla irukku;
I like this one;
no pinning no hashtags;
In it's infancy but so much more reliable than Twitter which is now a dumpster fire rolling down a hill crashing into every parked car along the way. Dark theme is beautiful and the photo carousel is beautiful. Missing embedded YouTube videos though.;
still have a lot to improve, we don't know what's working and what's not working... so far X is still better than threads by far;
At this stage in the app's development, gifs, vids & pics work, but hashtags don't. There's also no translation function. Those are both big problems because they limit how much I can interact with different groups that interest me.;
it's okay. it's not bad, but it needs work.;
good;
you can't post new threads anymore;
This is nice app and also same Instagram thanks;
Please do not add it into insta .. please;
I like Instagram 😊;

Way better than X, formerly Twitter. No rate limits, lots of active posters and people, and no begging for subs or a paywall like Musk's garbage app.;
nice;
Give u just one suggestion....pls make a like by double tap on images.;
Awful;
would give this a higher rating if there was more features that every social media have like hashtags. being able to change user without logging out. beyond that it's already better than X. thank you for giving us a place to go to without getting overrun with bots and scammers.;
Super;
"This App Is Better Than Elon Musk's ""X""";

Best app;
Topic search results need to be sorted chronologically. Not doing so makes this app worthless to me.;

For the past 16 hours, Threads has not been working. Unable to update my home feed. Unable to post. Unable to reply. Full internet connection and every other app on my phone works fine. I've been patiently waiting months for basic features to be added, but as of now it's not even functional. Clearly, Meta is not my choice to replace Twixxer as my app of choice for current events. Should have known Zuckerbergs latest would fail to live up to expectations. Deleted app Oct 5th 2023;

Time and time again it happens that my feed updates automatically without my wanting to. Can this stop? Otherwise, this app is decent.;
there is zero engagement...why would I bother making good content for 1 or 2 likes when I have 1100 followers...this is the same complaint we all have about Instagram..let people see us again...find other ways to make money than hiding us and then extorting money out of us for ads to get seen.;
WHY DOES THE APP KEEP CRASHING EVERYTIME OPEN IT?? HORRIBLE;
I'm just hating;
poor;
takes a longer time to post after hot the post button than twitter;

This app isn't very good and u til you allow adult content it won't beat X (Formally Twitter) as they allow adult content.;

In general, I'm not a social media fan. I go there out of boredom and to read articles and news. But Threads? My Gods I hope it doesn't change because I love it there. Threads is super easy to find a community, there's no ads, etc. I constantly find myself scrolling threads and making new friends.;

Give me anything to use other than twiXtter, and I'll happily give it a go.;
Dope;
i'thinks this app is very safely and use for quality is great. Am'i seriously enjoy like that. Thanks.;
Apart from the not being able to post things without appropriate warning, I feel like the app is Great but it needs more upgrade and they should allow posts to be edited for God sake. 😅;
Nice app 👍👍;
like follow nahi karte hai yaar;
AmserhKumar;
Privacy concerns. There's no reason this app needs to know my texts messages, emails, location, my contacts information and so forth. Avoid this and tik tok.;
Nice aap 🥰🥰;
Good app;
A breath of fresh air;
How do you even post?;
easy to use still a Lil underground popularity wise but I gave I a 4/5;
Terrible. It filled my account with really lame, random, unsolicited posts by people/groups that I don't know, about things I dont care about. I uninstalled it.;
For the instagram same Twitter;
Most useless app on the Play/App Store. What did people use it for like a week, now no one cares. It's attempt at competing with X/Twitter failed miserablely.;
i like thread application;

I love this apps.;
I cannot add Muzik to my video the Threads like Instagram;
Very nice;
It is ok but growth and engagement is just bad as Instagram. It is faster, easier and less clunky though. Not being able to put the threads link back on your Instagram profile is rather backwards.;
Only as successful if people actively engage. But needs active hashtags and useful use of lists to streamline threads brought to us.;
I love ❤️ threads ✨️ really great app download for device 😊;
Mast 🔥 app hai;
I love it;
worst app 👎;
I sm just trying this app....don't know in future I will be comfortable here or not;

Usable. It's ok. Edit: it's way better than Twitter, I meant X, it doesn't as complex as X, better layout/interfaces, it looks better! It doesn't show comments that I hearted! Love it. Need a feature that filters out the post I don't wanna see, like I can hide post with words that I don't like.;
If I wanted Twitter style news feeds, I'd install Twitter. Why did you have to screw IG up with this nonsense. I hope it fails.;
better than Twitter, but that's such a low bar these days. Needs some tweaking and refinement, which I'm sure is en route.;
🥰🥰🥰🥰;
⭐💫🥀⭐💫💫❤️❣️;
Better than what Twitter has become;
Since launching this platform over 300k user around the world🌎;
👌👌👌👌;
No way to register in this app. Why does it require that I make an Instagram account?;
Very good app;

The app lacks something;
better than ig insight;
It just occupying your phone memory;
Twitter is cringe. Facebook is cringe. so Facebook makes a knock off Twitter that's more cringe than both, with less features than both. I wasn't going to leave a review, but after deleting the app, Instagram is now showing me threads from randoms that I never even followed. shows how desperate they are lol.;
Not as good as twitter .;
Absolute WASTE of an app. If you don't already have a huge following on IG literally no one will see your posts. There's no reward for posting. This app failed to produce dopamine and therefore I cannot become addicted to it. That's a failed social media if I've ever seen one. Plus they refuse to listen to what people want added, of course. Such a gigantic waste of time. Huge let-down. Meta disappoints yet again.;
Unnecessary notifications sent to Instagram. Irritating.;

I tried using Threads but it's a major echo chamber. Twitter/X is much more diverse. And Threads has a horrible privacy policy. If you care about your data at all, avoid it.;
A nice way to detox after a decade over using FB.;

Would be a perfect Twitter/X replacement if there was a trending tab where I can see what other users are talking about, or the ability to follow hashtags.;
Good apps;

Cool concept, but not nearly complete enough to even compete with Twitter. Also, there are barely any active users compared to Twitter. Popular accounts only get around 100 likes per post while on Twitter they'd get thousands.;

Dont see the point in it, we have enuff social media platforms that everyone enjoys using already, whats the point in doing another one thats does the same thing 🤬;
Using lessons learned from other socials, I have carefully curated just who I'm following on Threads, and am very impressed with the genuinely engaging and interesting people here. Love it. Creatives, divergents, interesting and caring. I'm sure you could just follow news outlets if you want. Celebs. Whatevers. But it's a nicer vibe, and getting better. Needs a few more tricks.;

1st: Copying X that's way i don't like, no one should copy another App but they should work on a new idea. 2: You cannot delete your account because it will delete your Instagram. 3: It will pop-up with your Instagram username name which look awkward.;

Running a flagship s22 ultra and tbh not impressed. Glitchy/Stuttery feel both on feed scrolling as well as posting. Thought you knew what you were doing considering? STILL NO LANDSCAPE VIEW!! My phone supports it, why not your newest app? Gonna wait for a month and see if rectified on issue & feature. Otherwise going to delete!;

Missing Video Scrubbing This app isn't as mature as Twitter/X yet. But it is acceptable. Other than not being able to scrub through videos, the app has almost everything you need. Except direct messaging, though I do not believe that was ever an intended feature. And I'm fine with that never coming to Threads.;

Wow this application is better for all applications;
this app has been so positive! New updates have made it almost perfect!;
Free Palestine🇵🇸 Mark is deleting our posts all because we defend about the Palestinians that are killing everyday If you support Israel then you don't know the facts actually you don't know any thing ,your press hide the facts the told you another story Palestinians are the oppressed people Kids are killing everyday Where's your humanity when they were killing for years ago?!

Being in the Meta Community, these apps are trying to silence anyone talking about the genocide & crimes committed in P@l3st!ne by Is rael. Stop preaching about freedom of speech when you can't accept the truth coming out. Let everyone see the evil in Is raelis and the crimes they are doing. Shame shame shame on you!;

Before publishing, search and confirm the truth. Israel on Monday ordered a total siege of Gaza, cutting off the water, food and electricity for its 2.2 million residents, which is a classified as a war crime under the Geneva Convention. Israel has ordered 1.1 million people to evacuate northern Gaza, but they remain trapped in the blockaded enclave. What is happening in the city of Gaza inside the occupied Palestine is a terrible thing that can not be tolerated by the human mind!! The whole cit;

As a journalist, retired teacher, and proud boomer, Threads is (so far) an oasis of calm and reason. Be careful posting trending news. I don't need it here. Do you? If you explain your point well, I can go from there to discover on my own. I follow credible, learned communicators in all fields, because that matters more now than ever.;

don't show me what you think I want to see. I understand there are people who want to waste their time on random, or entertaining stuff.

تطبيق منحاز للكيان الصهيوني المحتل مثل غيره من تطبيقات شركة ميتا Une application biaisée en faveur de l’entité sioniste occupante, comme d’autres applications Meta. An application biased towards the occupying Zionist entity, like other Meta applications Eine Anwendung, die wie andere Meta-Anwendungen auf die besetzende zionistische Einheit ausgerichtet ist;

Racist application and Unfair;
"I enjoy the app, but the app screen has stopped refreshing when I pull down and release the page; the IG logo at the top just continues to spin....on multiple devices. I have notified Threads of this more than once and nothing has changed. I would think a bug like this could be fixed.";
Thankful.;
good experience 😃;
Trash;
In our life every day we live with thread .whether it is life-thread or cloth thread .But to get it polished and make it a habit in our life need lot of hard work and dedication and we need to start accepting the situation .If our thread has a weakness our life button will start slipping away from us. Just want to greet you thread youare doing pretty good being connected to our life and withthesociety everyday everymoment and every occassion whether it is our birth or it is our death.#rtnblogs;

Has very good potential. Needs to improve navigation and traceability. Search options should be enhanced and we should be able to see what is trending.;
it's getting better;

Just another trying to be shadey tree;
Twitter copycat. Was hyped in the beginning. Now I don't know it's importance. Guess you can't delete the account because it's linked directly to your IG. Delete it and your IG is gone forever. How convenient! 😁;

Ok app;
Fake news;
Such a refreshing and welcoming change from the toxic X platform. Threads still needs a few more features to be complete, but I'm already using it far more than all other social media combined!;
hello Instagram account help me;
Worst app;
Shskit;
I like the theme, the interface... everything, BUT im looking forward to more updates and upgrades of this application to get more useful and enjoyable to use like Instagram and Facebook. Thanks;

Worst App , threat to humanity;
App was fine till an update messed it up. Now it don't load anything and just constantly buffers;
Absolute bias towards Israel and double standards against the Palestinians;
double standards;
🤮🤮;
Biased and unethical;
Ch kya;
Racist app It blocks sharing Palestinian victims while it posts Israelian injuries;
Bakwas application promote like scammer;
meh. it's turning into twitter. used to be a pleasant place, now it's full of zero post accounts trolling everyone;
nice app;
Meta support censorship when exposing genocide;

Saurav;
Awesome 👍 congratulations 🎉;
This app is limiting Palestinian content and media out of their support for genocide and occupation. Choosing the side of the oppressor against the oppressed;
Best Excellent;
Wonderful 👍;
Dont deserve more;
😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨🥳🎂🥳🥳🥳;
Seems unnecessary;
it should be have the unhide your badge option on instagram because many of people hide's his badges mistakenly and now want it back;
Free phastin;
Like;
you closed the accounts that post the truth about what's happening in Palastine . you dont deserve even 1 star for supporting the oppressive war criminals of Israel. Free Palastine;
Not good;
I love you;

I am having a massive issue with bots following probably 200 per day;
Not useful so bad experience;

Such a hypocrite behaviour man you guys are brainwashed Just wait for the day of judgement;
Bad experience;
Hate promotion platform;
Racist;
لا يوجد ترجمة للتصويت .... لا يمكن الغاء التصويت او تغيير التصويت... لا يظهر قائمة الاشخاص الذين صوَتو.... هماك مشكلة بكتابة بالحروف العربية يمكنني كتابة جمل عادية لكن الخط الذي يومض و الذي يُظهر لي اين وصلت في الكتابة يكون في بداية الجملة عوضا دعن نهايتها و مكان الارقام و الرموز و الاقواس يصبح معاكسا;
Videos I make cannot upload. Please fix, thank You.;
Zioinism application;
Love the speed of updates but, needs cross platform messaging!;
Nice👍👏;
caussisgoods;
I installed this only bc I hate the new Elon Musk contolled Twitter SO much. I'm quite confident that many others feel the same way. I hope it's good, but at least it can't be any worse than the new Twitter. It must be hard to be both a genius and a dope at the same time!;
"TL;DR Better Twitter, No idiocy is allowed here. 9/10, 5* Only on Threads can you find those dippy-doos from Twitter getting sauteed to perfection for being in Cult45, and beyond. It is not a safe space, but this space is safe for you to be you, and you will not be without friends. It's even got better community guidelines, and posts do actually get REVIEWED by a HUMAN, if not initially screened by one. Also, followers and following folk feels so much better, and engagement is thought-provoking.";
سيء جدا;
Bad app will never use it;
لأن شركة ميتا تتخذ سياسات معادية ضد فلسطين والفلسطينين وضد حرية التعبير;
Awesome;
This is very bad knockoff Version of Twitter;
Engagement through the roof vs Twitter's paywalled engagement. It's a healthier, happier community with voices elevated based on community votes, not based on whoever has $8 to burn.;
Bad;
It's suppression of opinions;
beast application;
crAPP 💩;
The most racist app , offensive and disgusting;
worst experience i had with using this app buggy, not showing who i am following;
Starting to turn into an awesome app 💯;
Very nice 👍;
Account immediatly banned before finishing setup with no way to appeal. Took it as a sign to not pursue using the service any further.;
Good morning;

Absolute bias towards Israel;

it's much better then.. that other cesspool;
Its not easy to make a followers is not useful 😏;
it is very fantastic 😍;
better than X, people are actually nice on here, I just deleted my X account because of all the nasties on there. happy to be here that's for sure, I'm a lover of all animals & thank you. 😊;
good ap;
Nice 👍;
The unfair content policy against palastine;
Fine social media, features are coming along. 10/10 if you like porn bots though, they are absolutely everywhere.;
The app got a strong launch, but the low update velocity killed most of the momentum and engagement levels have tanked. I'll increase my star rating when I get more features to approach Twitter app parity (and more), such as: - Hashtags - GIFs (from Tenor, not Giphy) - Direct Messages/Private IM - Trends & Trends for you - Lists - Auto feed refresh without manual pull - Creating polls/survey questions;
Boring;
Good;
simple to use even if you don't like being visible;
I like this of Threads app.;
Worst app @!!!!!;
Racist;
Bc of the platform bias about the Israeli genocide on gaza;
such a refreshing change from the failed Twitter site!!!;

Threads changed my life. Loving the vibes. 😎;
nice app;
Very bad app 😕😕;
UX of this application sucks, like there is no option to create a new account from threads app, imagine if someone had to create an instagram account in order to create threads app. Chat function must be added if you guys want active users, cuz if user can chat here the might spend more time than just scrolling the feed so i threads will only attract the users which they already have so threads might not be long lasting....;
failure;
absolutely good 💯;
Free ya kos omk;
its fine to have your own ruls, but the application is bias and having DOUBLE standard which is NOT acceptable!!;
Absolute bias towards Israel Ptl;
I honestly have no idea why some of my friends aren't on Threads yet despite how good the app is lmao. Great work, Meta!;
Nice 🙂;
I love it;
Lets you edit posts without forking over 8 dollars a month.;
"I deleted after an hour. I received a notification of a reply, but just said it was unavailable. Couldn't open the original ""thread"" i replied to. And why use this over any other platform? It seems just like instagram but not as good.";
Getting interesting now 😉;
it's a redo for Christ's sake.. don't mess it up XD lol so yea I like it.. monitor yourself and monitor your posts- don't be a noodle, be a star;
MST app;
Bad;
Great experience, just needs ActivityPub support;
Bias towards certain sides in politics is against the open nature of social media. No thanks.;
Please;
some people are good, some are suffering why the world is like this;
good morning 🌞 good 👍🏾 for us;
Good for threads (another tweets). Need more features.;
Free Pelastian;
This app is very bad I consider this application like a garbage which gets accidentally downloaded in our phone and which we cannot even delete due to the fear that our Instagram ID may also get deleted... Do not download this application😡😡😡😡😡😡;
I'm not allowed to tell the truth;
new twitter;
Can't download. All I want to do is delete my Threads account which I thought I already did. Insta says I have new followers which I suspect is a lie to get me to download this undownloadable? app.;
Kinda boring unlike most platforms. Seems more like self promotions for the fudge of it hahahahahaha Psi-chopathicpeppamintpimpin 🤣🤣🤣🤣;
mujhe like nahi mil rahe or follow;
Bias against Muslims and Arabs.;
The community is good, people from all kinds of interests and backgrounds. They keep adding good features to the app frequently. It's easier to build a following here. People seem to be more mature and it's easier to manage the toxic ones.;

"Won't stay on the ""Following"" tab and constantly forces me to see content I don't want. Even on the Following tab it sometimes takes me back days and randomizes the order of posts. Review will be increased when I can avoid the For You tab.";
Good;
Very nice threads an instagram;
Nitin jatav 💪🦅;
Racist policy, supports mass killings / genocide.;
A bit addicting but also very informative;
Completely useless. What ever I'd use it for, I'd rather do in FB, IG, Twitter (X), etc. A completely redundant and pointless spinoff for IG.;
Meeeh;
Palestine is free, no to blocking expression;
Not funny;
it's very nice;

So nice😃;
Could be better. I recommend not displaying suggested posts and accounts (that I do not follow) on the Home feed. I'm planning to use Threads for staying updated with the news but when random nonsensical posts and memes pop-up, it ruins the experience.;
#FreePalestine There is no free speech in this platform our in other meta platforms... Mark just block anyone who spoke about Gaza genocide;
تطبيق متحيز و غير حيادي و يستخدم الذكاء الاصطناعي بشكل سلبي لمصالحه الشخصية;
One of the worst application of the year;
مش مليح ابدا تطبيق زباااااااااالة لا يدعم حرية التعبير 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸;

Censoring freedom of speech and pushing the terrorist propaganda of icereal;
Lovelovelove;
Very bad application, I do not recommend it;
لا توجد حرية تعبير;
There is no expression liberty;
Awesome 😎;
لا يوجد حرية;
It does not deserve a single star because it is against the Palestinian cause, works to silence voices, limit freedom of expression, and is biased towards the Israeli side. Freedom for Palestine 🇵🇸;
An application that supports the occupiers;
Vimal bhardwaj;
No freedom of speech;
I deleted it A racist who is biased towards Zionist gangs;
It might be considered mostly due to my lack of adequate tech but I find the app difficult to navigate within and organize.;
I feel sorry about this app twitter is better;
🇸🇩🇸🇩🇸🇩🇸🇩;
cool when we getting trending page zuck?;
(تطبيق فاشل وعنصري ومنحاز كليّا لإسرائيل .. لا يدعم الإنسانية ويُقيّد حرية التعبير ويحضر المنشورات التي تفضح جرائم الحرب الصهـ*ـيونية والإبادة الجماعية) للأبرياء من نساء وأطفال وشيوخ ..;
As an android user I should have first access to the GIF option and I don't, pathetic;

very good;
X twitter is OG;
Nice chatting with someone else Government;
Twitter (x) is much more bettttter .;
I ❤️ my Instagram and thread;
good app;
Install if you want more of the same - more ads, more content geared at making you addicted to the platform, more content making you hate humans, more of Zuck selling all of your personal data and manipulating public opinions. Such a disgusting company and platform.;
very baad;
تطبيق سيء جداً جداً;
Bhut nast hai ye app ladki pitane me bhut shayta krta ❤️🙏❤️❤️❤️hai love ❤️❤️❤️;
Undecided. I do like the option to share posts. And I like the option to post direct links. Will those be worth my time to pursue in addition to my other social media accounts. Not sure yet. Would like to see some additional benefits to using this app.;
Best social media in a different decade;
'Threads' is a good platform.. appreciate if it is added with some add-on gears;
happy;

Good;
I can't share anything without the app crashing;
Not able to set feed to following.;

Nice app;
Needs trending topics, otherwise nice to be Elon Muscovy-free.;
no insights provided on the thread;
Why is your algorithm using a current genocide/two-way, ethno-religious nationalist war to direct users to downloading your app? Anyone curious about this, reach out to me and I will provide screenshots. This is insane.;
good;
The worst 🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮;
𝘂𝗲𝗷𝘄;
Useless App 🤬👎🏻;
Useless;
Baaad baaad baaaaaaaaaaaad;
Five stars if this app doesn't die off in a few months or a year / 2. Keep updating and improving and its cool for me.;
Dull;
Que basura, me tengo que registrar con insta, importa mi perfil de insta y luego me quiere obligar a hacer un perfil nuevo, total que mejor la borré;
