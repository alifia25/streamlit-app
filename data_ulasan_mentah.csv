Good application ‚ú®;
A poor version of Twitter. Meta should just give up at this point, the company sucks the last 5 years.;
;
;
;
;
Wanna know about this app;
Good lounch app;
;
This app is 90% Copy Of Twitter, It's cheating...;
;
Great app;
;
Better than Twitter freedom of speech üí¨üòÄ;
Best app atleast for now it's yoo good üíØ;
;
;
Nice app üëçüèª;
;
;
Twitter is better;
"Instagram in a different format .. how is this ""Twitter's"" competition?";
3rd class application boring;
;
I can' t signup new account, need to install instragram something.;
Finally this app realesed. It's more useful.;
"hate the algorithm, ain't no one likes my postsüòí plus the badge won't be removed from my Instagram acc tho I choose ""remove""";
Room for improvement;
The badge keeps coming back on IG profile, even after you select to hide it several times.;
;
I don't need separate/additional app just to share my ideas or minds, there's already Twitter;
Can't log in without Instagram account. Not interested, bye...;
same as teitter , so not interested in more social platforms forms offering nothing new. tcs;
I can't find Instagram bottom;
;
Firstly I want to say that this Platform is too much Useful and Advance with all the new features and I Love meta ‚ù§Ô∏è;
I think you should add a private message section;
it's amazing and it all free;
;
Threads is more better than twitter.üòéüòé;
Plz try to remove threads I'd from Instagram bio. I don't want to use threads application in my Instagram id so plz solve my problem bcz you are putting this forcefully to our Instagram id and after starting this app u can't delete your I'd so plz solve my problem everyone are not happy with this app. Thank you;
Until now I have not faced any problems regarding its usage and good thing is that it doesn't contain any type of ads on it.;
I wanted to use this social network, but unfortunately its algorithms are built to destroy freedom of speech and support the Russian invasion of Ukraine, accordingly one star.;
Copy paste of twitter.;
;
If you still have instagram gotta install this just to login using instagram only chat with private friends so don't see much use of any of it;
;
I can't post videos since üòèüòèüòè failed failure;
Buggy mess;
Best Social media platform To Shareing Own Activity...!!;
;
;
;
;
This app is an amazing app, very interesting, but it doesn't have a future of direct message.;
its ok but such boring its good but somewhere is missing. overall its good;
don't sale our data meta;
;
Y'all need an update asap;
;
;
Until it becomes a dumpster fire like other platforms it's not bad. Bots are making their way into the platform, and I care not to see posts from accounts that I do not follow in my feed. Would like to see migrated over the translation feature at least;
"I think it's a decent start. Some features I think would be important going forward, though; the ability to search topics and tags rather than just people. To go along with this, the ability to follow specific topics would do much for the ability to curate a homepage. Also, having an in-app direct messaging system would do much to improve the experience. Other than that, and the fact that this app is still in its infancy, I can see a good potential for Threads as a platform.";
Can't install the app;
I can't open the App üò•üò•;
It doesn't connect on my phone;
Very poor. My feed is full of rubbish, not from the people I follow. I can't even turn the dross off in the settings. No chance of replacing Twitter in this state ü•±;
Unusable app. The whole app starts glitching as soon as I scroll;
;
Im impressed this aap thanks for lunch this aap;
This is amazing appreciation;
DID I even install this app on my phone? Now I'm beginning to get very weary of META.;
;
;
They want me to pay for a service that show's no improvement;
When I try to write a post the app shuts down. It's done it 3 times in a row now. It's the latest version and fully updated.;
Lack of features...;
Awesome experience to work on this day I will manage it possible;
;
I won't to delete this app , but I can't;
Yeee I think this is good;
Cool but mine is having shredded display;
I'm not sure if it's ready to be a good app,it needs a lot more than it is, and my opinion is that it shouldn't be a part of Instagram but totally something else;
First and foremost, the user interface of Threads is beautifully designed and user-friendly. Navigating through the app is a breeze, with intuitive controls and a clean layout that makes it easy to find what you're looking for. The app's attention to detail in terms of aesthetics is commendable, and it truly enhances the overall user experience;
It's important for youth;
Yet another social media app. Bridging Instagram and Facebook to compete with Twitter. Not great, not horrible...just another scroll trap. For some reason there's no way to see stuff you've previously liked.;
;
Pointless app. Resource hog/battery killer.;
Use of threads after one day, Shuru mazboori me kiye the ab mza aa rha hai üî•;
Steals way too much data it doesn't need and is just a breeding ground for unhinged liberals to brainwash kids;
;
Stuck on login screen;
Nice App;
Best app;
Very simple app.;
;
Need the option for switching into other accounts like Instagram, it's quite a hassle, after being addicted to easy switch method in Instagram;
"The logo of the app reminds me of the cover of the novel ""Play it as it lays"" by Joan Didion üôÇ";
Twitter copy paste;
Scam;
I fell it... And it is best compare to twiter.. Bye bye twiterüòÖüòÖ;
I don't have Instagram.. but I want to have Threads... this is not possible. I can't log in.;
;
This app became place for sexual and onlyfans promotion within 5 days;
;
Cool but idk if this is relating to my issuse but ever since i got this my insta acct that's linked to it keeps crashing??? Themes wont work??;
Nice of this app guy'süòçüòçüòç‚úå‚úå‚úå;
I love threads. It's kind of like Twitter but it's a bit different.;
;
The app's concept is greatüëçüëç;
;
fix the bugs issue i dont use it properly;
;
This is a new app I hope it will be good;
;
Copy of Twitter;
Beautiful apps... .;
Easy to use;
Hey I'm not able to post anything with pictures....Do something about it;
;
its so good to use such an app which is better than twitter. please when are you guys releasing the pc version. we cant wait for that one too.;
;
Here's my honest review: It's not a bad app, but there could be more features alike that could make the whole app more fun to use. Much like how Instagram allows you to switch accounts, maybe Threads could use the same feature. The only method to switching is by logging out currently. What I liked the most was the dark theme that it came with upon opening the app. Easy to get used to.;
;
;
This app is perfect for understanding your point of view;
This app is garbage, collects highly personal data that is unnecessary. Tried this out it sucks deleting it now.;
;
;
Why does it want my personal data? So they can sell it to businesses and profit off my personal information? No thanks. Uninstall;
App is clearly not ready for release. Integration with Instagram is great, however the biggest letdown is having the home feed being filled with randos, with no way to make it *only people I follow*. I'm patiently waiting for this issue to improve. Otherwise good concept, UI is great, user experience is okay;
To use this app they need to collect every single bit of your data. They know if you believe in God or not, they know who your friends are, your family, where you are at any time, they know what websites you browse. They know literally EVERYTHING about you. And the most terrifying stuff in all that, is that you ACCEPT it. They tell you that they collect everything about you (to sell it) and you accept it. Wake up. WAKE UP !!!!!!;
;
;
;
Constant crashing when trying to upload most photos, although there doesn't seem to be a pattern of image size or resolution, which causes it to crash or simply fail to upload. I have, however, been able to upload images up to 44MP, 33MB successfully uploaded. Would like the option to clear the random rubbish from my feed without having to keep muting them!;
I think this is best app for Twitter;
It's an app that violates every thing about privacy worst idea ever from Instagram;
;
Need to improve media support. You cannot copy paste images/gif via clipboard. Every time need to import it from attachments icon. Voice for videos is not working as well.;
;
;
So this this Zuckerberg's tuntrum trying to copy Musk just like he copied myspace. Why can't he be original?...;
Just a dumber version of twitter. Can't be even called twitter lite. And just like all Facebook apps, it's censorship pron and also say goodbye to your privacy.;
;
too buggy.. the screen just overlaps with its previous state and the whole screen goes bad;
Excellent app my first experience on that,so it is exceptional it great then twitter;
Broken application. Sometimes some message disappeare. App has been removed;
Yall experiencing pages and posts overlapping each other... Go to profile, theres button at the top right corner then report a problem.. just go there then go back to homepage and the bug's gone‚ò∫Ô∏è;
Fantastic app thanks Mark jukerberg;
Huge network problem;
I am unable to login or sign up.. Because I don't like instagram so I don't have account on it that's why on threads I can't even sign up that's totally wrong when you launching a new app you should have atleast that much sence to take non Instagram users on ur platform or allow them to use it;
Threads need some translation cause being an international kpop fan is so hard when there's no translations;
Threads doesn't work properly on Vivo device screen is spread and got stuck please fix this issue...and plzz make it Android 9 version;
Its really cool specially in the first version, it also be cool that when we scroll up, see the app icon to tap it and get a better reflesh action;
Excellent alternative;
I just know that for threads to work properly it will take a couple of years. Cause it took twitter a long time. And also if you delete the app it deletes your instagram account;
;
I just installed and then uninstalled, totally wasted, if you don't have any Instagram account, you can't to login in threads, and we all know that Instagram is a su*ks.;
Much better than Twitter, and currently no Elon fan boys;
;
;
Good stuff;
Instagram team please don't under review my video;
Bad app;
Great alternative to apps like Twitter. I actually enjoy it way more.. somehow different;
The greatest ever and more than that bird icon with blue colour ü§üüòéü§£;
More than a twitter;
It's glitching every time I open it;
Good app NYC experience;
It takes a lot time while installing... Reach of the posts is not so good...;
Super op appp;
This app is very lacking I can't even swipe anything;
Copycat! do I need say more??;
Bugs;
;
Because deleting the insta id;
Copycat app like Twitter. Unethical!;
no dark mode?;
;
The application was not working well.when I was it's showing nothing just scraching.not proper working.very bad experience.better to use Instagram...;
It doesn't run ... Get crashed everytime i try to use it;
;
While trying to upload photo the app is crashing;
;
Amezing this app but chat option available in threads app;
Its wonderful app ‚ù§Ô∏è‚úÖ;
Has nothing new;
A great app given the fact it's only been a few days since it launched but there are obviously some flaws into it. For example, when I want to post a picture, it often kicks me out of the app and takes hours for it to allow me to post that picture. I also usually can't see who just started following me, shows me my followers fine at first but once I surpass 50-ish followers, I stop receiving notifications and I can no longer see the usernames of those who follow me.;
To much loading im still waiting very bad app;
I downloaded the app it was all fine... I connected it to my insta account but as soon as I started scrolling it got hanged and smt weird was happening like the app was having some bug... Plzz fix it..;
please add translation optionüò≠üôèüèª;
Too good liked the AI and UI of the app üíØ Instagram connection is a great way to enhance the use of both apps. Great reach with least marketing. Happy threading.;
;
I wanna like the app, but it keeps crashing every time I try to post a photo;
;
;
I like it;
Worst experience as it is not opening even atleast for 2 times i have uninstalled it still not working and now i have uninstalled it;
Very nice app, but its missing a few things such as switching accounts, hashtags, taking pictures, etc Its very smooth and well optimized, unlike instagram for Android which is ironic;
Nice & Good;
It's gud;
Faul app, not closed to Twitter;
If I don't have / want an Instagram account so I can't login, that's not acceptable. I am uninstalling the app.;
We need an organized feed that doesn't lose position everytime we move from it. Have it at least load a certain number of threads that will be shown next when we drag down to refresh the feed and so on. Such a basic feature;
Good;
As usual, Mark is stealing other people's ideas, one star for this one, for sure;
*Twitter* killed.;
Worst aap when I'm opening this app it's getting close ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨;
lemme explain what scam this is, It will not deactivate even if you deactivate. also, when u want to delete that stupid badge on instagram page, it will appear tone after time after timeeeeee!!!!;
We shall see.....I hope this stays unlike twitter;
;
This app could use a free mode, like FB you know;
It's been glitching ever since I've downloaded it;
If I wanted to be on a subpar app where disinfo was not being flagged and allowed to run rampant, I'd just stay on twitter.;
This app is far better than Twitter ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ** Writing this down so that mfs from insta don't join twitter **;
The App crashes again and again, think the developer for to give it the testing team, and push it to live. I'll download the next public release.;
Very bad;
;
It is the wich can break down twitter;
Zuck a copier Useless app;
;
It actually have a lot of bugs! Thread team should fix the bug first before it launched!;
I can't find follow requests sent to me in the ‚ù§ section. It was there but than disappeared? I am very disappointed with it;
Crashes when uploading pics;
I had Awesome Experience using, User Interface is simple, No Fake Accounts, Bots Trolls etc.. like on Twitter hope this app will Replace Twitter and Be A Better Alternative.;
I think it's a really nice app üëçüèæüôÉ;
I think it's linked with a an app called *'Sure Fixed Matches'*;
Please give me myy account backkk;
Unable to upload 4 picture;
Good app;
;
I wish there is a chat option in threads too, so that we are able to share threads with one another on the same platform instead of copying the link and sharing it on instagram. Also, it would be better if we are able to download the video or the picture directly. I personally feel that maybe threads should be a part of instagram instead of being a complete seperate app.. Just like how reels are a part, threads should also be a part of instagram. That would be nice and easier.;
Not bad so far;
"App bans your accounts (Instagram too) for truth about Ukraine. Another app for making money on ""pink"" news and products. Avoid it.";
So far so good.;
;
;
Not username change;
;
It's just a clone of Twitter;
The app was using about 99% of my battery. Deleted it and my battery was working normal.;
Meh, I'm on the fence about it. I know it's new but it has a bunch of things that needs fixing. The timeline, if that's what it's called, needs to show stuff from who I follow, not everyone. I'll check the replies for those comments. Need a dark mode option and ability to make fonts BIGGER and maybe a bold option as well. Also a definite need is when you open the app or refresh the thread, don't go all the way to the top. Keep the thread where I left off, thanks.;
useless, can't even change name or username other than Instagram.;
;
Great app really but highly addictive (send help);
;
Requires stupid amount of permissions, can't delete account, and looks awful. It's a very disorganized mess.;
This app is recommendable for fast com.;
Try to add bookmark feature like Twitter;
AWFUL, TWITTER BETTER;
This app is a privacy nightmare, collects all of your data and worst of all it's owned by Facebook;
Ducking app;
It's definitely cool;
Great app;
Is very realy;
For an app that just launched a few days ago, it's honestly pretty good!! However, there are a few things I'd like to see improved & made: hashtags, folder to save threads, draft notes.;
;
;
Nice competitor of Twitter;
Needs more features;
Twitter was so much better than it .;
Hi dev team I downloaded this app, and I have been trying to login with ig as requested but it always fails saying there's a problem trying to be fixed. What's the problem?;
We can't text in the app;
Collects way to much data;
Carry on;
Ok, first of all, many things are missing in this app. We need a poll option, we need to be properly able to share links, and a lot more gimmicky stuff is missing. Please add them ASAP;
Always keeps crashing when iam trying to upload something;
Copy of twitter;
Very trash app twitter is 1000X better get free speech then we can talk;
Mind-blowing;
So far so good;
Please work on the sounds, there are no sounds for notification on Threads Also, we can't message privately;
A very good App;
While it's still adding features, sure, it's not MuskTwitter and it's pretty close to the old twitter, so enjoy!;
;
Best;
Not bad;
Me aparece buggeado el texto, todo se mira borroso;
For a just starting app, it's suprisingly good. Like astonishingly so.;
Such a cozy platform visually, in my opinion. Just cannot scroll through my notifications.... can yall fix it that?;
Something is wrong with this app, cause it's not working on my phone at all. It's just cloning pages like hundreds and thousands;
;
;
;
Is this threads app safe or not Social media talking about thread pls uninstall the app if don't uninstall u r instagram was deleted ü•≤;
Threads vs Twitter üòÇü§£;
Not as good as Twitter it's similar to Instagram;
Ugh, Mr. Zuck collects too much personal data with this app. Let alone all the political bias on his platforms. Stay away!;
As a developer and a normal user, the app is really easy to navigate through and also has a simple ui.;
;
Copy of twitter .;
;
Nice.;
Very Bad and Boring üòÇ;
App is not working properly it is stuck in The middle;
Unnecessary.;
Nothing is interesting in the app. I was expecting something new.;
add a separate feed just for subscriptions and let us choose a general feed by interests or hashtags. i mean, the adds are fine, but not the whole messy feed.;
First of all I like this app. But this app is not working properly on my device maybe it's because of my old device. It's glitching, overlapping subrato pages in one page, etc. Other than that it's an amazing app.;
Just a cheap copy of Twitter, man they even copied the blue check.;
Threads is such a fun app but yes it can do with a few improvement but for myself it's perfect the way it is. It's definitely a goodbye to Twitter from me üòÅ;
i think THIS i's better for Twitter every body yous it this amazing apps;
Does not work!;
I wanna give them a 5star but they've gotta make an option where we can make dm, like everything is literally public ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ WITH ALL SAID, I'M ALREADY ADDICTED HAHA;
My followers stop increasing at a point why;
A torrent of meaningless celebrity spam and random posts from people I've never met.;
Needs a lot of work in my opinion. Not getting notifications when those I follow post, all notifications are on, still nothing. Would love it if those I do follow are 1st on my feed. Also, a translate option would be great as I follow non English speaking celebs and have to screenshot posts for translation.;
garbage ui, cant post images due to errors.... more r&d needed if you wanna rip off twitter successfully...;
I keep getting errors when trying to post images.;
Honestly, I haven't had many issues. I do want to see more functionality on this app. When I hit play on videos the sound doesn't play.;
Very bad UI.;
smells good and not musky like Twitter;
My insta keeps crashing ever since i joined threads;
Lots of bug;
I literally just installed this app and it won't even let me open it. It says the app is updating right now to try again later. How is the app updating if I literally just downloaded it?;
Multiple accounts needs to be included. Some of us have multiple Instagram accounts.;
;
Awesome;
;
Not much;
You can't delete your account without also deleting your Instagram account. Don't sign up, it's not worth it.;
It's the worst parts of Twitter combined with the worsts parts of Facebook;
Needs more features. You can't search posts. You can't use Hashtags. If you have a lot of Instagram followers, then chances are you'll have threads followers. Otherwise, there's no other way to get followers on here. I hope that you develop this app furthermore.;
Nice app ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è;
i can't even download the app, keep taking my data, downloads still 100 but never installs so terrible;
It is not all the Hype the Media claims it is;
Bestüî•‚ö°;
Better than Twitter already;
Love this app;
;
It would be great if you can add the feature foe logging in multiple accounts at the same time. Just like insta;
Useless pale copy of Twitter without soul and no fun and tremendous use of data. Pointless.;
cheater! Why can't we delete this account without deleting our Instagram, trash company,;
Love it;
there's a glitch in the app;
As same as Twitter üòÇüòÇ;
Best App;
Fix the algorithm first. I don't want to see those verified accounts on my timeline;
worst social network ever;
;
;
I don't use IG, pero gusto ko sana to i try kaso hindi makaka sign in unless may IG account.;
ASL enduku swamy e app em use undhi ? ( No use for this app üò§);
This is the most amazing app in the world. I saw it on Facebook today;
Not good, it requires an Instagram account, totally unsafe, your public opinion linked to you cellphone number, your personal information made public.;
I think it is great but some features needs to be advanced. First the photo loading time is still slow, secondly I suggest that all Meta Apps could be synced inform of tab/browser where you can switch platforms easly. For example if you are in threads you can have switcheable icons or tabs to navigate to Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and vice versa. Fourthly, there should be filters through which people could determine thematic areas of interest including themes, topics, personalities, etc;
A twitter alternative for intolerant leftists who can't cope with conservative opinions and want them censored.;
Twitter is better than threads ü§ê;
‚ú®It's just a copy of Twitter;
We need features here.... Thread Groups or Pages Maybe direct messages Hashtags Translations Reactions (like, haha, love, care, angry, wow, etc);
it is the future since elonnn destroyed twitt er;
;
I can't delete my account, they have tricked the users. And I can't even remove the badge from my Instagram account. It's like they are forcing to use this application. Losers, come up with your own ideas, stop stealing and copy pasting stuffs.;
Please don't put the letter's counting this is not good I wanna talk too much and express my feelings freely please solve this and let us be free in what we want to say ..;
Trash not threads. Twitter was long dead, musk just killed it. FB is long dead, now thief is simply trying to copy and squeeze some green out of dum peeps. People want to get their name, so they flocked there...will they use it? Nah...because it's just trash.;
Don't have an Instagram account and was no prompt to just make an account for this app. Maybe they'll figure it out later but currently useless app for me;
Great app twitter rival and a good one I used it on the first day of its release liked it. Mr musk is making twitter limited and pay for blue tick is very bad. Money can't buy everything. Hope this app will stay and more and more people come on this and this app should not follow the steps of musk and FB ads factory and keep our data save. Good luck treads.;
company policy is the same. you can't call a spade a spade, upload photo evidence of war crimes, because it doesn't make money, you can't sell advertising.;
5 rating for memesüòÇüòÇ;
Please make it to show us post who we follow it not every post Here is a lot of post from everyone to we don't want to see Thanks üòä;
Was exited to try because, screw elon, but I'm not handing over all my data. Sorry can't do it.;
A wonderful and new application, but it is similar to Twitter, the only difference is that it is owned by Meta;
Better;
We need gif, a lot of funny gifts.;
wasted many hours downloading this app yesterday. Once I went near Instagram my Threads information was not locatable;
Zuck is a cuck xD Copy and paste garbage not even worth 1 minute of your time;
Copy, paste! And how can I permanently delet my account?;
App crashes upon trying to post content just another poorly executed copycat from zuck himself;
If you don't have an Instagram account already, you cannot even login to this app! There is no option to create an account here. Uninstalled.;
Worthless app for now. Created out of spite for another website, you know the one. Will update if it ever gets better.;
Can't post. Whenever I try to make a post the app crashes;
Twitter is your official Father;
The app is still new and I have installed the app for the first time. The setup was easy to do. One thing that I would love to see on the app is that you can upload videos on Threads and the other thing is that you can delete your profile and data because I have read that the only way to delete the data is to delete your Instagram account which I don't like because it's going to upset people when they want to delete their threads data.;
The app is good;
Trashapp. Had to sign up twice and still getting banned or under review after i have written the code on a paper received through my email and phone and also took a selfie. Like damn what else is there for a new user to verify lmao. Meta is a sensitive weakarse company who will never be better than twitter. Update: threads finally let me sign up and verification completed. I hope they don't piss others off but I give them 4 stars. Minus 1 star for pissing me off in the beginning.;
Doesn't refresh üòï stays on the same thing üòÇ;
Get that option to look at your own Likes;
Worst app total copy paste;
Good üòä Twitter vs thread Thread wan;
Very boring a bad and poor copy of Twitter.;
;
Apparently an Instagram account is needed, so not for me;
My Vote For Twitter. üòâ Sorry @Zuck;
To much data collection, sensorship, and ownership of images. Zuckerberg don't need anymore apps. His companies phony fact checks to control the narrative is unreal and the extreme censorship of speech. I'll stick with twitter thanks.;
Doesn't work with me I wanted to try it but it doesn't work for me;
I get the idea of competitive marketing, but making it this aggressive and making me have to delete my linked instagram to threads. U get one star;
The app was okay for the first couple of days and then all my verified accounts and political nonsense. Not even two days and it's turned into Twitter pre 2022.;
Need to be able to only see people I follow in my feed, there's too many accounts I don't care to see.;

Threads seems to be the reason why my Instagram has stopped working. As for threads itself, I can't see the replies I'm getting. As soon as I have IG back I'm uninstall the whole lot. The functionality is just terrible.;
Wao nice app;
A horrible clone of Twitter abundunt with censorship and data collection.;
Crashes the Instagram app;
Try to add download feature;
Too many privacy concerns;
Sorry but I love elon musk;
Nice app;
I like it. But it needs improvements: 1. Please add the Options to choose pics from another folder. Its so hard to find it just to scroll down all the way. 2. Add the login option for IG lite user like me. This app is good right now especially I can post longer messages, (of course it's name is thread hehe). Good job Meta üëçüèª;
You can't use keywords to search for topics,big negative for me but I am looking forward to seeing the development process;
A fair warning: using this app gives facebook the right to all your data, and you can't delete the account without deleting your instagram account. Aside from that issue, there is so much basic functionality missing. How did Facebook (Meta) ever greenlight this app?;
I will happily download anything that could help Musk fail. ü§∑üèº;
My app is not running clearly;
It's a great app however I can't open my Instagram now üò≠ why?;
Better than Twitter;
New social media outlet;
Weird and cool luv it;
I'm loving the App Why you can't save pics on the App like Twitter or post any nudes on the App We need these issues fix;
;
;
Tis good;
Good apps and easy use;
The app threat people like a product and not a person. Taking your every detail including your personal health information... No wonder it can't show it's face in the EU. ü§¶üèæ;
This app don't work well at all on my phone;
Needs more functionality to compete with other social platforms like direct messaging and searching for anything other than accounts. Currently, the app is down for many people and there is no logic to why it went down. That is surprising and disappointing for such a big corporation already rooted in social media like Meta.;
Just installed, won't open;
I want to post a pic but it auto exits.;
I have a problem with the app;
It is an imitation of the Twitter program, why do I need this program when I have Twitter, it is stolen and the rights are taken;
Best app;
Extremely bad app. Has been screen lag from last 3 days and tried many time to fix it by redownloading the app but still doesn't work. Extremely worst expreience.;
Why does this app need so many permissions? I permanently deleted Facebook from my phone because somebody told me that I was online, but i did not open the app that day. Why would this app need biometrics and reroute phone calls and reorder running apps and see your health fitness and what other apps you have and activities you're doing and all of that?? Never going to use a meta app again;
I really love this... At least there's another room for opportunity... Twitter ads are cost . And getting engagement could be difficult.... But welcome THREAD....;
App crashes everytime I attach photo.;
Getting crashed for no reason..;
Buggy login experience but now I'm in. Much better platform than Twitter or Reddit at this point.;
Another app to waste time and sanity on ü•∏;
BEST APPS I HAVE SEEN EVER.;
Like other meta garbage;
Please Instagram calm down don't disable my account again please üôèüôèüôåüôèüôåüôè‚ô•Ô∏èü•∫;
You're completely locked in if you sign up. No deleting your account unless you wanna lose your instagram too. Not to mention you fyp is covered in posts by people you don't even follow;
;
It's not working;
It cool;
I would learn, like, love from my thread.;
I want to express my appreciation for threads‚ú®;
This a good app for chat;
Isse ek baar I'd banane pe isse delete account krne pe aapka insta account bhi delete ho jayega It's so very bad üòû app ü§£ü§£;
Bad app;
;
Needs instagram's explore page, DMs, and more features;
Amazing app loved it would have given it 6 star's if it was possible;
Trash. It's a tracking app. Do not download;
Very good app;
Great app with a lot of potential! However, there is a lot that needs to be fixed. For example, the option to mute accounts is lagging/delayed. This feature is definitely needed at this stage, which is part of the next problem. Another issue I've noticed is the home page shows a lot of accounts I don't follow and have never heard of, and a lot of blue check accounts that I don't want to see. There is no way to filter them out to see the content I actually want, from people I follow.;
;
I'm getting notifications from 2 days ago, not most recent. I would like to be able to sort my feed to only people I follow.;
Exellent app;
;
Zuckerberg gives the same one word responses Musk gives;
It's provides a good experience to build something meaningful.;
Visual bug can't even use to scroll list;
;
This app seems pretty good so far, but I have noticed that any post notifications have been a day late in being delivered!;
;
;
;
Not useful;
Most welcome new app;
Glitch in the Matrix!;
Its pretty decent, however I'm having problems with my notifications. I get the notifications VERY late, sometimes DAYS later.;
Nice app;
terrible app. Can't create a new account.;
That is twitter lite version;
;
;
I hate threads im from people twitter im son elon musk;
Best APK ü§û;
Making my personal instagram account crased;
Brand new;
Great start. Now keep updating it please.;
"Looks stable on Android so far. Please add an option to disable ""Autoplay"" function for videos.";
Terrible experience. Just use mastodon directly.;
;
;
Trashy basic ui it looks like they shipped it early just to take advantage of twitter being down;
One problem is facing no one liking the post;
"Threads ban accs that does not support Russian war... That's not ""off politics"" as it should be.";
UI is not coming properly. It's blurry can't read anything. So, please help me to fix it asap;
;
;
This app is not enough. I didn't like it. Because if we log in this app we will be stuck. If you log out from this, you will be logged out from Instagram. You should find a solution for this as soon as possible.;
Not happy at all. Do we really need to deactivate our Instagram profile to get rid of the Thread profile? Disappointed.;
Pretty much excellent start but I wish there was a minor option to just view the threads from users I'm following instead of everybody. Also there is no current way to search for a particular threads.;
More useful like Twitter üòú but ise usse adhik le Jaya ja sakta hai . Jai hind üáÆüá≥ sabhi koüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ‚ù£Ô∏è;
The Size Should Be little compressed ... And I Highly Recommend Makers To Make the feature which if any user want to delete his threads account then he/she Threads account only deletes , Not The Instagram account ü•∫ As Insta is a emotion whereas threads is just launch....;
Just another platform for right-wing nutjobs.;
"Cannot save pictures & crashes posting pics! Twitter allows you to save any picture; Threads blocks downloads. On Twitter, I can easily post a picture; Threads crashes if I try to post a picture. Ridiculous! So far, this has been a pretty miserable app! I hope they fix it soon.";
Their ii so glitch;
I just wish this app had translation capabilities. üò™ I follow some very successful and super nice people from Japan and South Korea. I'm trying to learn how to read both languages, but translation capabilities would make it a little easier.;
The app invades users' privacy by abusing the public's lack of attention. I would like to delete my threads account but for that I need to delete the Instagram account, forcing users to continue using that app. This is completely ridiculous, you could have done better.;
;
Such a amazing app, nice algorithm;
This app so amazing and have full fill all the requirements;
;
My Instagram account was hacked after login into threads;
I want to remove my threads acc but not my instagram;
Could use a change of theme;
;
App is glitch, everything is mashed up together. Unusable;
;
Its an amazing app;
Not working properly;
I can't upload photos or videos. Every time I write a caption, the application immediately exits suddenly, why?;
;
Good social app;
;
;
It's trash.;
Very nice app üëçüëç;
Worth it alone to see Elmo seethe and rage alongside the right-wingnuts.;
Not promising at all;
Just an FYI, a lot of these bad rating are from Twitter, and they don't like how it's not up to their expectations cause they are used to how Twitter is. Definitely not the app for them. Threads is new and more for the audience that is on tiktok kind of way. So, of course, they are gonna say the people posting on there sound stupid we are young and posting for our audience that find things funny and entertaining in our interest.;
it is a good option to opt twitter;
Cannot uninstall it deactivate my id when I delete it. Worst privacy;
;
How user friendly it isüòçüíØ;
Good aap;
Everyone should just see the data collected by this app.;
;
Worst APPüòí.;
;
Here it is also 10 million;
cant post gifs they come out purple and green and distorted and am not the only one that is happening to fix the app;
;
THANKS TO SO MUCH I LIKE APPLICATION;
i hope there are threads lite tooü§ß;
Unable to upload an image.;
Is good;
Very useful app üëç thanks insta for gifting this type of app‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è;
Its a trap üòÜüòÜüòÇ;
Much better than Twitter;
It is a very good app but there is a small problem, if we delete it when we don't need it, our Instagram account will also be deleted. Other than that, it's a better app than Twitter;
"It's moderated Twitter as opposed to 4chan esque current Twitter that is nearly impossible to check in public because it's become overrun by hate and bots for a particular blue and white website. DMs coming soon. Users concerned about privacy; if the app is free, you are the product. There isn't anything on this app that is going to know any more about you than the little tracking/gps/algorithm driven device you carry in your pocket everyday already knows.";
;
I feel really old, but I remember this app from back in the day called Twitter‚Äîit feels incredible, how far we have come as a species.;
Always very nice;
Problem1 : WHERE IS THE FOLLOWING TAB?? Problem2 : when I type in a text, and it lengthens , the text doesn't scroll up. Instead it gets covered underneath the on screen keyboard I'm typing on making it impossible for me to view the text while I'm typing it. Desired features : those 5 reaction from Facebook next to the standard Heart Like. And the no. Of views on a threads like Twitter has.;
Threads are better than twitter;
;
So far, so good. Simple and easy to use!;
This is great I recomend it to everybody;
Cant upload an image says failed to upload thread if i try to add an image;
;
Better this application ‚ù§Ô∏è;
I'll continue using instagram and WhatsApp cause they're good but Threads is not fun to use, rather use twitter;
;
App has way too many phone permissions. No way to turn off or delete without removing Instagram.;
I can't even use it properly. When I started to scroll or at least go to the other tabs it started to glitch and overlaps everything. Please fix this bug in the next update, I can't have the same experience like what my other friends does.;
;
There are a lot of glitches.. Whenever I'm trying to touch the screen it‚Äôs being overlapped..;
;
;
;
Not useful ,just a copy of another appüëéüëé;
Nice aap to threads an instagram aap very nice;
Bestest app üíú;
It is lagging and glitching too much ... I am not able to use it.. So frustrating;
Twitter flok;
I don't have Instagram ac.;
The application don't work properly... The interface is weird the letters are overlapping each other;
yeh app bhout bekar hai yeh app download karna se apka instagram connect ho jaye ga aur yeh app dellet karna se instagarm restart ho jaye ga yeh app install mat karoüò†üò†üò†üò†;
Good app...;
;
My account delete;
Great app;
Better than twitter ‚ù§ü•≥;
text selection is bothering UX facebook's component was much better please consider using that one;
the app crashes when i try to upload photos. it's so annoying.;
Glitches;
Clone copy of Twitter.;
;
This app may share location and 12 more informations to third party apps. It is similar to fb and insta! Where is privacy after sharing my information to third party apps üòî Disgusting;
Didn't know Reddit and Twitter had a child ü§∑;
;
;
A refreshing social network that I truly need! Hopefully, the positivity and good vibes from this app will continue throughout the journey.. Better than than Twitter toxic community app! Definitely must try.;
Good project;
My threads app is glitched. It is not working at all. I hope Instagram team will fix this problem soon.;
Great app!;
very good app üëåüèª;
I have glitch in this app firstly I enetered all was working but after my second enterance the app hot glitched in which there were 2 oberlays in that solve this problem plz;
;
The error that is thrown in the UI is super annoying. The exact same thing happens to me every day. I didn't think this error would happen that often. Fix that problem.;
Can't delete threads account without deleting Instagram! Why does it need so many permissions that don't seem at all necessary? It's literally a copy of Twitter but with more censorship, tracking, and creepy personalized ads.;
This app is good.;
Slow work;
;
;
Worst app don't install this app because if you delete this app then your Instagram id will also delete;
Best app of our generation I love it;
;
;
;
It has a lot of bug... I can't even open the application;
It has a lot bug. Not working properly;
Very good App;
Horrible;
;
The aap is although very good.... But the refreshment takes a long time... And overall experience is good enough.;
So bad app;
The data collection is insane. Why would a twitter wannabe want my financial info, or my health info? Jesus, tone it down a bit, zuck.;
Not bad. It should allow you to save images and stuff. If this is gonna be a Twitter killer then be a Twitter killer.;
Nice app thrads vs twitter;
Dm options needed;
Change the app name with Threads aka Memes Central;
What is wrong üò≠üò≠ not working only crashed üò≠üò≠;
This app feels like if Facebook tried to make a Twitter app. It keeps crashing. Had to uninstall, now trying to reinstall;
Dekhta hu isme blue tick milta hai ya nahi;
I enjoy the app and viewing what is on it, but I can't even post on it. Every time I even attempt to post something it glitches out. So I'm just bummed about that :/;
Not download;
Stick with the OG. Twitter is far superior;
Crashes every time I try posting a simple photo. Happens with both Samsung Galaxy S21 and S23. Would love to see a way to toggle between random posts and those from only people I follow.;
this is not only bland but full of cringe Facebook users who thinks this is still 2012;
;
Starting was good like login and editing the bio. But after that when I opened the app to see what type of features and contents it contain. It started glitching and always it acts weird. Didn't expected this type of bad work from Meta. The application needs a lot of development. Looks like it's a launch without trial. Very disappoint. Want to delete my Threads a/c but for that Instagram a/c also will be deleted because thats the algo. Dissatisfied and Disappointed.;
Need other means to login apart from insta. I do not have insta id.;
Too many garbage feed... Please optimise your algorithm like the one use on Facebook or Instagram...;
when i first enter the app big app glitch just happen;
Knock off dollar general versiom of Twitter.;
;
Looks like twitter clone;
The app is super cool and I love its features ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüß°;
M#C jukerberg Wasting Times of Fool Peoples & Earning Money üòè;
No concept;
Best app;
Kinda boring.. missing a lot of features or is hidden in the UI, can't find the trending topics for the life of me. The UI looks simple, too simple;
Total waste of time, nothing new thing üòû;
;
If you login this app 5 later your account got hacked Instagram;
;
Stupid, Twitter is goat;
Mine keeps crashing when I @, quote or add a photo, tried uninstalling reinstall restart phone..... Nothing on Google to say what the issue is. Phone works fine with all other Meta apps;
Good first draft. It runs smooth and I am sure they will be adding functionality. I don't think they expected so many downloads right away but yet it doesn't crash. They seem to have only rolled out what has been well tested. Also, it's not filled with weird vaguely eugenicist posts by the billionaire owner, so that is cool.;
They don't support freedom of speech if your view does not align with them you will get banned I wouldn't recommend using it;
;
Nah elon better;
haven‚Äôt seen any bug untill now but the scrolling animation is too much laggy and it feels too much annoying. this should be 120fps like meta's other app.;
Threads crashes everytime when I post photos. I use Android.;
;
Complete disaster. On top of that it doesn't let you take it off of your phone because IG might go too. Doesn't let me upload some pictures and I sent notification 2 times and nothing.;
;
Great Instagram texts based conversation app Really amazing üòç;
Poor Knockoff of Twitter;
Fun to use, but can't post gifs;
;
Best memes app;
What is this app, twitter basically but with censorship;
The pest app;
Just include hashtag & Trending features. It will be better than twitter;
The app is great but not for those who have the version below android 9,, cause whenever I try to open the app.The app's home page becomes glitchy and scramble,, So this is a matter of regret to the meta authority that they should have be more senciere before launching the app,, though its a bug associated problem,,,,;
complete twitter knockoff that looks irrelevant AF;
Better than Twitter;
Forgot your download;
Hmm nice;
;
If you're using this aap don't use it . If you connect this to your Instagram profile nothing happened. If you deactivate your threads profile . You see many issues on your Instagram profile . I'm facing that problem. . don't use this worst app . Non worthy ......;
This is good app and my ID inda_likhari;
Better than Twitter üòäüòç;
This app froze first, then it got repaired, and afterwards, my Instagram is missing so many posts from feeds. I've reported multiple times, still no result.;
eehh fine app eh looking really sharp looking good look at your app shiny;
I'm facing a great problem from today. I can't see whom I'm following on threads and even can't see my threads and replies that I've posted on my threads account, my following and followers number isn't correct instead it's showing my Instagram account's numbers! Please fix it fast!;
It's got a long way to go yet. Not ready;
I dont want to see algorithmic content at all, but the userbase and integration with Instagram is nice;
Best app and better than Twitter ü§† I loved it üò∏.;
;
;
;
why is it glitching so bad? i cant enjoy the app pls fix this problem;
;
No creativity It is a copy of instegrm.ü§¨ü§¨;
Amazing app;
It's glitching every time I open it;
Bugs.... Everytime I open the home page... It keeps blurry and showing some duplicating effect of texts.... Still needs more improvements;
Perfect;
It's a great app and it's really easy to navigate but there's still a lot to be done.. Add a Message Button, Add Tags in Search, Add in settings where one can disable or enable Public Replies, that should be private. Thanks;
;
Yeah this sucks. Where's the NSFW artist where's the fun in that? I believe it's going to die quickly like NFTs I just don't want the servers to die down from Twitter. I have a great time on Twitter than this I don't even think of. They'll update later wish they probably won't because the creator who made this is an idiot that doesn't have one for PC which ruins the purpose of what Twitter and Instagram have;
Great Concept ü•∞üòáüòÅ;
;
The name is funny, but it is convenient to use.And it's like a Burmese word(·ÄÅ·Äº).;
Good app;
;
Great design and all, but has a lot of bugs. It behaves weirdly on Android 9, unusable..;
When i open this app its just glitiching for every time.. I canot login in this app with my insta account...!;
Its too bad ....m kya khamakha.... just like this;
Worst app of all times;
Beautiful app;
;
Ok! First of all change the that deleting thread account will delete Instagram account too ...;
;
doesnt load , all laggy , experienced like someone hacked my phone lmao , uninstalled it after;
;
;
;
extremely buggy not worked for a single minute;
It crash like hell;
;
Not bad appüòâ;
Good app;
It's a good app but it consumes a lot of data just like Instagram;
;
As of launch there is no way to sort your feed chronologically and no way to show just people you follow on your feed. As a result of this your feed is nothing but celebrities posting psusdo self help positivity and major brands trying their hardest to make painfully unfunny posts to get clicks. At the present there aren't true ads but when your feed consists primarily of brands and corporations making constant posts with no way to get away from them it's kind of the same thing but worse.;
Biggest size app. Please reduce size.;
;
this app NEEDS IMPROVEMNT.. there's no translation yet.. i follow korean authors in threads, and i need to screenshot their post and go to Papago app just to know what they have posted..;
Nice aap thanx u;
;
;
;
;
;
Twitter is better üê¶;
I'm trying to switch my account to private but it's not working... Not satisfied üòï;
;
;
It's a good app. My only concern is that it ruins the resolution of the gifs and short videos I uploaded. They end up blurry when I posted them.;
Dont download this app if you want to let your instagram work properly, as I have downloaded this app and started my profile with the same username as in my insta. But after 24 hours my insta app start getting CRASH , However when I logged in with different account on my insta app it works properly.;
Super üëå nice üëç It looks like similarly Twitter .;
Keeps closing when typing. I'm using a Huawei P30 and it just closes when typing, more often when typing @ then a name but it's mega frustrating. I'm giving it a 3 because of this. Otherwise it's a fantastic new app and the absence of DMs is an absolute winner and game changer.;
I think thread is completely broke the record;
Why when I use it , it's glitching . I did screenshot it. Does my device not compatible. It can't be, cause I'm able too download & play games like genshin impact, etc .;
I having trouble about logging in using my Instagram account.;
stop stealing Zuckerberg;
Despite the fact that the app is still developing, I don't see the reason why it keeps scrambling up when I try scrolling through the threads. This needs attention pls.;
This app better than Twitter;
;
;
;
i love it;
;
;
"Everything is smooth, but is there an update happening? Couldn't seem to open the ""following"" nor ""pending"" tab. I hope it'll be fixed! And also, add ""my liked posts"" tab, and a feature for hiding some posts/threads from specific followers only to be viewed, if that's okay. Overall, I love the new social media!";
Twitter is far better than this;
Excellent app by the meta.üáÆüá≥üåè;
Good application acchi performance best app;
please add polls/edit text, also improve the algorithm, i followed many people but i still get so many random threads that don't match my interest or anything from random people;
Best your application;
Much better than Tw(a)tter, the blue birdüò∏üò∏üò∏;
When I installed this app it doesn't work properly and work like it's hanged my screen doesn't work properly in this app, and I was trying to work properly automatically from 2 days but it doesn't .;
I am enjoying it so far but please make it so you can change between profiles!!;
attractive app, goodüëç;
Crashes like no other!! I could hardly. Post any thing without crashing every single time!!;
;
;
Buggy at the moment, I've not been able to post pictures.;
;
My threads was so hanging;
I need message like Instagram so I don't need to open other apps to share any threads;
Nice app üëç;
;
The app is not displaying properly;
Need messages options like Twitter üòçüòçüòÉüòÉüëåüëç;
App crashing after trying to share photo from gallery to app, unable to filter follow only feeds...;
Security detected this app attempting to access my banking apps. CORRUPT and UNSAFE app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!;
It's a Superior Upgrade Version of Twitter. Welcome To Earth üåé;
It was a good experience but I'm still going to stick to my other social media.;
This app is good but sometimes it's just give nofication like from 2 days and it's always make phone battery from 100 to 80;
;
One thing this app is good and it's on time where we'll get to see latest things more than Twitter. But one thing keeps me annoyed is that whenever I'm scrolling and a video pops out I always have to unmute and next video comes I still have to unmute like I just can't stop doing that. So that's the only problem I'm facing with this app so if that's fixed by next update I'm sure I'm gonna put 5 stars on that;
I think this app very great,keep update for new fiture;
I looked because of Selena Gomez;
;
Amezing app;
Good app;
Its not working while using on the tablets fix it please.Though it's working fine on mobile phones;
;
I also like this apps. Very nice;
App not load properly but overall it was better than Twitter I love it;
App is glitchy. It paints/blurs all over when i scroll;
Good innovation;
I don't even want to give one star After downloading threads my account is been hacked So never download this app The worst experience of this app üôèüôè i could not even find my account üòî lwra app;
My thread isn't working properly please solve this problem;
Glitchy asf;
Much cleaner and not a mess like Instagram but copy of Twitter;
;
Wth is wrong with this app??? It showing glitch pages .. it doesn't deserve even a single star;
Really great;
;
One of the best app;
;
It's good for earned money;
Amazing app. Still need more features to take people off Twitter. Need to stand alone from Instagram, shouldn't be limited to users of Instagram. I don't like Instagram so much but I love the thread.;
Copy app;
;
Nice appü•∞;
Good app;
Good experience instagram and also thanks for this ‚ù§Ô∏è;
Nothing is loading, none of my old threads are showing up and the app so just super slow in general. Uninstalling and reinstalling to see if that fixes it but I highly doubt it;
Best app;
This really is trash.. just another app to be irrelevent on and follow famous ppl as if they don't have our attention enough is a big NO for me.. if somebody gonna make another app atleast let it have some substance;
Its barebones twitter, hopefully they'll update the features quickly, will give 4 out of 5 untill then.;
This is good but not as twitter;
A platform to stay positive and find happiness at minimal things. Threaders Unite! Don't know for how long this positivity will continue to exist but right now it is at its optimal level, #KEEPONTHREADING;
Not working properly, all sections are getting disturbed;
Copycat app.;

App is not stable;
Best app;
THREADS>TWITTER;
Please i need an answer ASPA is it true that if you delete or your thread account got hacked. Will your instagram account also be involved;
Twitter better;
This app is not useful and downloaded this app by cheating ,then we can not delete this app.;
Apps very good;
;
Marvellous;
It's a new app, and I believe it still needs improvement. While typing, the keyboard covers the text, which makes it hard to see what someone is typing. Also, I think it make a lot of sense of I can see people that follows me on their profile.;
Too much censoring;
Better than Twitter;
;
;
All Good But Refresh & Scroll Rate is To Much Slow Please Work On It...;
Very nice app, i am impressed with it very much and it's software optimisation.;
;
;
Much much better than twitter;
Better than Twitter;
Crashes when uploading a picture so what's the point in the app. Shouldn't of rushed getting it out;
It's a good social media platform this app may be helpful & easy to work it.;
Best;
;
;
There's an bug in this app on today;
Very bad experience withth the app it's shaking and getting blur over all display experience was very bad... !!;
Cool plateform I really impress bost business then this plateform right choose;
;
Love this;
able to access my emails, sms, and private messages? no thanks;
I'm really enjoying the app but I have a problem, my action is always blocked and anytime I try to add a photo before I post the app closes by itself. I don't know why it's happening but I wish you solve it, thank you.;
;
Beat app;
I love this üòª so I want to try because someone tell me this is a good app‚ù§Ô∏è;
Best app üñ§;
;
;
;
It's a bad copy paste of Twitter;
Just copy the Twitter concept with low UI and features quality as social media app.;
So many bugs while writing keep showing my keyboards not keys, Fix that issue;
Look like instagram.;
Vary nice app;
Not so good , even now I can't delete this thread account from threads;
Its pretty average..more like twitter from 2007.;
"Not only are serious security shortcomings prevalent, but placing ""Post"" & other interactive buttons at the bottom of the page means they are obscured by QWERTY & Google keypads on most smartphones. By comparison Twitter has all functions top of page.";
The application keeps glitching since i open it, once i touch the screen it glitchs, can't use it at all;
;
Pretty darn solid option on the social media landscape;
This app is not working;
Can't cmt post on android, the keybroad hide the text input;
Twitter's dumb clone;
I'm very happy but you know what? I didn't become a member of this app today, I mean on the 10th. And I am giving a review without using the app. What's wrong? the thingüòÅüòöüòú;
We need more features like DM,modifie a post,boost;
Best experience ever;
;
;
Unhappy in this version;
;
It's a SPAM MESSENGER;
Perfect ü•∞ deleted that silly bird app and will use this instead ‚ù§Ô∏è mark is the best;
;
;
Crashed my Instagram account ü•≤eew.;
;
Not working üò≠;
I like;
;
so clean! i love how minimal the monochromic color pallete that was used.;
Better than the twitter app as I'm totally loving it!! ‚ù§;
Very good using this app;
;
;
It is meaningless app;
It's a good platform for socialize as like Twitter. But Today after 6 to 7 hours of installing the app got closed till now it is showing try again. I uninstalled.;
Seems like Twitter;
Best üëç.lets introduce DM to own people.;
It keeps bugging;
Unrefined for a big corp app.;
Censorship;
Very basic and poorly interface;
;
;
It's so so;
;
What's the point of following people if their posts never actually show up on your home tab? Instead all I see is random people posting about how much they like Threads, so it really just looks like the app is trying to make itself look good without actually doing anything useful.;
;
Please do something. The app is not working. This app is horrible üòî;
Thank you meta nice üëç app i like;
;
Rubbish App üò°üò°üò° twitter is best ‚ù§Ô∏è;
"There's a lot to be desired for on this app I would like to see a ""This person follows you"" badge on someone's profile who follows me. A feed option of only accounts that I do follow. And most of all, being about to choose specific folders from my gallery to post pictures and videos from. The app is smooth, but uploading photos sometimes crashes it. Otherwise I can see this being a potential killer for Twitter.";
;
Looks like Twitter, but only shows you people and topics you have 0 interest in (unlike twitter) What did Meta do with all the data they collected on us?;
I hate this app üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®;
This app full copy with Twitter!;
Uhive still my favourite social media.;
Privacy is guaranteed in the app;
Worse social media ever Change those things 1. Deleting process 2. Username changing 3. Link account changing;
Worst app ever Zucky;
Worst experience ever, lags a lot. Just a bad copy of TWITTER.;
Copy paste and bad copy;
Its fun;
Fun, but lots of room for improvement, since its only a few days old will probbaly be much better over the next few months;
It works with only your current instagram. Why ?;
;
Awesome apps üòÅüê±;
Trillion dollar company makes app that lacks basic features and will delete your Instagram account if you decide you no longer want their Twitter clone.;
Very simple easy to use and amazing applicationI'm looking forward to the live streaming and audio chat functionality between friends;
;
It's wonderful I like this üòç;
It's a good app but ever since I downloaded it my Instagram has never been the same I've been restricted and can't use my Instagram I don't remember going against the guidelines can you please make threads less connected to Instagram it really sucks;
The app crushes anytime I try to repost a thread or reply to a thread with a picture from my gallery;
Tidak bisa upload foto;
It's decent but why use data form Instagram Even if you have more followers from Instagram but moving to threads mean you probably have to start at square one, no limits here.;
Collects way too much data;
Lovely twitte For insta;
;
Glitchy Profile;
See I'm totally against copying the already great thing which is existing and using it as a rival. This is a waste of efforts by humanity, I think we should be more focused on inventing new ideas and spending our energy towards that incentive rather than copying things!;
;
;
;
Kya fayda yaar yaha bhi koi nhi pategiü•π;
Nice;
Bye bye twitter i am back to @Thread thank you so much;
Treads is better than Twitter;
Nice but copy;
Worst app I've ever used , not recommend;
Nice aap;
Hey brohh don't worry this app is safe for you ‚úåüèªüôÉ;
Boycott threads;
Glitch;
Just feels like a really bad clone of twitter with less features. Biggest killer is the lack of a web version. Deleted in less than an hour of downloading it. Even with twitter on the downfall with Elon's dumb decisions, its still wayyy better than what this is.;
Just made an account and the screen glitches out immediately. Texts overlapping each other, it's a mess. Will get fixed though i believe, but will uninstall it. Wanna send a screenshot, but here is no option. F.;
Better than Twitter,üòé;
Arrogant expansion policies;
The app is good but instgram shall provide an option to delete the threads profile without deleting the instgram account.;
Too much boring.. jisko follow nahi Kiya uske hi posts dikh rahe hai... faltu jesa hai isme bi sab insta vali hi reels and photo post kar rahe hai kuch Naya nahi hai..ek chij 2 bar dekh ni pad rahi hai.. Isme option rakho jise follow kare usi ka dikheüòè;
Twitter is better..;
My application is crashing;
popular app with absolutely no use;
AMAZING APP;
It has been synchronized with the Instagram ID, which is very struggling process. I don't know those who don't have insta id, how they sign in to the app...?;
It very helpful to me.‚ù§Ô∏èüôÇ;
Arabic Should be Right Justified. Threads text, in languages other than English, should allow right-justify for people who write right to left. Otherwise, the default left-justified text looks unnatural to it's readers.;
i don't know why is it getting glitch!!! the page does not get loaded and so many pages at a time get opened!!!;
Awesome!!!;
App isnt working properly. It keeps showing glitches after entering dashboard.;
The Leftist Facebook tries to compete with Twitter, to mess up with a free speech. Uninstall it , throw it away, just like Target and Bud Light.;
Unusable. The app full of glitches, it's impossible to read even one post. Only posted photos are visible.;
Love the app way better then twitter;
Good;
Can't use it as I don't have an Instagram account. Not interested in Instagram so I'll just stick with Facebook.;
Nice;
The Best App;
The app is fun....but I have difficulties uploading pictures or videos..what could be the problem?;
Unaccepted error;
Love Meta ‚ù§;
Theards üëç > tiwtterüëé;
I want to delete my account without deleting my Instagram. Deactivating isn't enough;
Worth App;
This app is great so far for me it's better than stupid twitter the ui is nice there's little to no bots you don't get any of the dumb people so far and they actually take moderation so far a little better than twitter actually allowing things instead of saying existing broke guidelines garbage;
While the app is a good one,I can't post media on it,anytime I try to post pictures and videos,the app just closes... It's frustrating!!;
Great alternative to the musky blue bird.;
Very nice üëçüôÇ;
Good üëç;
Okay, can we save images and edit posts please üòë;
Why this app have bugs? üò≠ I can't use normally.;
When I opened the app, it's just like that I'm using Instagram.;
Make it at least to turn around on big tablets.;
this application is so cool I like itüëç;
Nice App easy for communication but I hope to editing the App To add Direct Message (DM);
BETTER THAN Twitter;
Nice;
Beautiful Appüòç;
It's seems boring, no cool features;
Nice app;
Can't switch accounts, no feed for people you follow. Pretty rushed job.;
But I'm having issues mentioning @ or trying to post a write up all of a sudden it just goes off like it just disappear üòîüò≠;
Just download and open it. No big sign up headache. When you follow people you have to click the bell on the top right of the screen for their profile so you get their newsfeed. All in all so much better than twatter;
Hang appp;
please bring the translatation to the captions and replies.;
It shouldn't be compulsory to have other meta accounts to access Threads . Only then it can beat twitter.;
Useful üëç;
Downloaded only to give 1 star;
This app make my display overlapping but its not fault in display!;
A good app artist friendly but need more features like translate hashtags.. trends and many more;
Superb app good look Twitter sa acha hai yaha aap;
Good social media app ‚ô•Ô∏è;
Awesome app;
The apps is outstanding broo;
The app is too censoring. You can't have meaningful discussions.;
Not interested aap;
Twitter is the best twit in the world;
I m impressed for this appüòäüòé;
Worst app...lots lots lots of bugs;
good app like Twitter;
Very informative app.;
Good üëç;
Every single window is just overlapping on each other.;
Twitter is not good,but threads is good, very good, exilent;
Good;
Best;
This app is totally useless Twitter is totally better than this app;
Couldn't even explore the app because of this glitches. Even for a small touch it starts glitching. Couldn't rate more unless the bug is fixed.;
Bad experience I think. It's been 5 days of use of thread üßµ. I have got alot of problems using thread because we can't save photos here we cant enter and give a long space here that makes a problem. Along with that there are alot of problem this app can probably replace twitter in future üòî yea I am also sad a out that but watching it's exponential growth over days I can easily predict it's potential in market. I hope thread can solve challenge user facing and makes a good user experience ‚ú®;
Good one;
Nice apps;
Wonderful;
Good apps;
Good One;
"The app is good and all but I can't seem to post a new thread, anytime I try I get this notification ""your thread failed to upload "" please fix it for me";
Awesome application there are some bugs that need to fix but it's a great start;
Best app;
Good;
Good;
Why there's a lot of accounts showing in my feed even if I don't follow them????!!!;
what is wrong with having to press the speaker button if u want to upload a video huh?? the button is so tiny and most of the times users forgot to press that button... it's so stupid. Also, what is the purpose of following someone if we're gonna see random people's postings in our tl anyway?? Do not see where you are going with this honestly. Except for the smoothness of the UI, the UX is noticably worse than its' competitors.;
Not bad üòÑ;
Twitter is many times best than this app because it is promoting those who are already verified and famous on Instagram!!!!! Where should new people go????? They have no Rights to gain fame?????;
Great;
I love that clean and convenient User interface. Keep it up.;
This is nice social media app;
Lack of features;
Great app, but I had issue posting on my wall. The app closes as soon as I picked a file to upload. Any suggestions?;
Worst app tbh as soon as I opened the app all the content was overlapping each other I couldn't even use it.. I installed it again but still the same;
Great potential;
The app is very good but it have a glitch in dark mode, whenever I scroll the words get over written, this is the only problem for me, otherwise it's fine.;
So far so good;
Good;
This is a best ever social media app.;
Very fantastic app;
Application is crashing while uploading picture. Can't upload even a single picture of small size. What the hell????;
Wow nice app;
Not working at all. Neither feed nor profile is working properly!!;
I love it.;
Awesome app I use this app and injoy this.;
Ui are good and intuitive, anyway the community not large enough and cannot search or see the trend of the hashtags.;
Super;
I am very much impressed by using the app, so I will tell you the same thing, you should also do it by downloading this app. üôÜ;
So. Nice App;
Nice app;
Good;
So funtastic;
The program does not want to be downloaded üò≠;
Its good app;
Absolutely better than Twitter;
Failed to upload multiple pictures in a thread.;
Very good;
Bad;
"Wasn't able to login with my Instagram account. The app keeps saying ""unknown network error"".";
It's so simple and easy to use with no ads it's literally the best rn;
Garbanzo, looks like MySpace had a bastard with Twitter. Terrible UI and nothing relevant.;
App is full of glitch. Fix it please.;
The App always force close when I Start thread...ü•≤ Oppo Reno3 Android 12;
not a single person I follow shows up on my timeline, just 3rd rate influencers. no option to see only those I follow? also when replying, I can't see my own prompt, the keyboard covers it...;
Gathers a ton of unnecessary data + can't delete account without deleting your insta account.;
Nice app;
I think this app is great;
Finally got it;
It's great, just wished it had dark mode and the ability to switch accounts without the app glitching out. I don't want to keep uninstalling to fix it.;
Good;
Better than twitter;
I had error and doesn't work for me;
Really great app. Obviously better than Twitter.;
Really so nice app.. I like itt. And thanku for you make this application;
Good;
It's too bad;
The whole thing is broken or bugged. Texts are overlapping... Please fix it.;
Best social media more time better than twitter;
App crashes when uploading photos;
Worst social media app;
For a while I give one star, because this application does not have a system to restore hidden thread badges on the Instagram profile. If there was, I would give 5 stars.;
Better than Twitter.;
very good app;
The algorithm is horrible & and it's a horrendous copy of Twitter;
I am try login to this app but all time error show . I am unable to login in any way for these three days. Please solve this issue.;
Overall, the app is good. Its performance is great for it being initial release. A few suggestions: -Ability to only see followed accounts on timeline -Trending page -Cover photo -Dark mode Pros: -My system font works on this app, while it doesn't work on other similar apps.;
Toxic algorithm. I prefer twitter;
Worst app ever;
Good;
Nice this;
It sucked. Already everything you say is censored so you can't even have an actual conversation. No thanks I will stick with Twitter.;
Why my thread is not function properly! What is this???;
Great app, easy to use.;
This app is glitching on phone... Kindly check for bugs and correct it !!!;
Good;
I got bugs and can't use the app properly, the texts and the images starts to flow and my entire screen gets filled with the floating texts as I scroll through it. Please look into it;
I see no advantage of using this instead of Twitter;
Twitter better;
Totally worse thing on social media.;
Best;
Super app;
I have struggling with the bug and glitch. It is not convenient to use, i did reboot my device and re-install the app but nothing changes.;
Please help to Fix upload failure;
Working Amazing;
keep crashing;
Good app;
Ok but no cool features especially for genz;
It's got potential, but it's bland and boring so far without many features , and locking people in via Instagram isn't cool.;
Not bad but still this app is connected with Instagram and I don't like this feature;
Good experience üëÄ‚ú®;
That's good app;
Literally it gives a great experience It is more better than any social media app;
Potentially brilliant, but at the moment there are just wwaayy too many posts from accounts I do not follow filling up my feed. Not sure it's chronologically presented either which is a massive killer for me.;
Great to use also secure form spam and online abuse , cyberbullying;
good;
This app is better than Twitter;
Osm so nice aap lovly to gooood;
Nice app , we need dark mood asap;
Nice app but unlike Twitter, we can't download the pictures and videos. Thats a deal breaker for me. Hopefully this option changes, because this app could definitely beat Twitter.;
Excellent app, prefer it to the alternative, freedom of speech shouldn't mean hate speech is allowed. 2 suggestion , please add theme option to edit to dark mode and threads should resime from last read instead of most recent threads. Thank you;
Great app. Would have give 4 stars but gave 5 to get ratings up. Lol;
CANNOT SEE FOLLOWING , ITS ERROR FIX IT;
This good experience for this app;
Languages should be translated down,edit of the post and download;
Better than Twitter !!!;
Waaaaay too many app permissions;
Can't post photos;
I am so excited as using the new app;
Something slowly apps;
overall is good, but please fix when i will post media, the apps goes to so laggy. So i hope it's get fix;
Idk can only give one bcz this app need to shows the whole replys comments and fix bugs;
Useless....;
Really good aap I just want a aap which can replace Twitter and look here it is;
Nice apps good;
Please solve the glitches in this app I can't use this app for so many glitches Please solve it quickly;
I cannot delete my account;
Nice;
Can't delete my account from this garbage;
Worst experience. Trying to upload the post since yesterday, 'Thread failed to upload' message pops up every time. Really frustrating. Did all the thing like , cleared cache, OS update n all. Still pathetic experience. These kind of things wasn't expected from a Meta product.;
Soo goodüòõüòáüòáüòáüòá;
Amazing apps;
"Well designed, easy to use, but it's refusal to allow any content that could be labeled ""nsfw"" makes it an easy pass as a true Twitter alternative. Political or personal opinions aside, without some sort of option to allow content in that category, it will continue to needlessly kneecap it's self. No normal person is going to use both apps, and way more then are willing to openly say it will continue using Twitter for this reason alone.";
You can't see the text input window when replying. It is covered by the keyboard making it so you can't see what you are typing.;
Very nice app;
First time open bugs üòÇü§£;
Search function only searches accounts, not posts or keywords. Useless. The timeline is all influencers, sports, and celebrity accounts w/ high traffic. I barely see the posts from accounts I'm following! After muting unwanted accounts my timeline has not changed in the last 12 hours and I can only continuously scroll thru the same handful of posts from yesterday. No option to view posts I've liked or bookmark things to revisit later. I know it's early days but these are critical features.;
It buging a lot when I install it and get irritated. When I try to scroll remarks of previous page left behind and can't read other thing please fix it;
Ever best satisfied application it is,besides extra facilities remain hereüòä;
Good career;
Worst;
My threads are having a bug or technical problem.;
The potential for a good app is there, but it's not good yet. Most notably, the front page is filled almost exclusively with people you don't follow. App is literally unusable until a following-only feed is implemented.;
Good;
Well i have 3 account on insta My name as firsrt and another two as sub account soon i creat accout on threads it give one of the two sub account as profile, i cant find any possibility to change my account name or picture.. Thank you in advance Regards,;
Nice app better than twitter;
nice;
Good;
Nice üëçüëç app;
Super app like;
Great alternative to Twitter. They still need to clean out the bugs, though. It's a little rough.;
Amazing;
Good üëç;
It is easy to use, and it isn't a hell scape like Twitter.;
Mine is not loading(opening) again after I used it on the first and second day, what could be the reason?;
"Terrible experience, the whole algorithm time line is the absolute worse, i am inundated with thousands of UTTERLY MALIGNANT USELESS ASININE content from""creators"" that i could not careless if they imploded, i spend more time muting accounts than i do posting anything, i don't care about this new feed I'm being fed, i can't search for content i actually care about, this app as it is, is absolutely irrelevant, that being said the interface is straightforward and posting is easygoing. D-";
Need a lot of improvement;
Okay;
better than twitter;
Super app;
Good üëçüëçüëçüëç;
This app not reach my expectations not good interface not useful at all;
There's much needed features missing on launch, such as dark mode, but with time I can only see the app improving. Until then, 3/5.;
Stupid app, privacy zeroooo;
Thanks for making this app;
Amazing application like Instagram i loved it ü´∂üíØ;
Nice;
Wow thanks this app very nice ‚ò∫Ô∏è;
Threads is a copy of Twitter. Nothing new. I have a idea for something that better than Twitter.;
Awesome üòé;
Very amazing and wonderful üëç;
I signed up with Instagram and then installed threads. In Threads, I muted several posters. I did not post in either app. but, a warning popped up that I had violated Community standards. currently apparently disagreeing with the algorithm is a violation of community. if I wanted complete lack of control I would go back to Twitter.;
Better than Twitter;
Boring;
Good;
Was beginning to enjoy it until I started constantly seeing post by someone I'm not even friends with. Literally every four posts there they are. It's not my page it's their page now I'll check back in on it sometime in the future when more friends are on;
This is very awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è love it;
This app is nothing special other than hiding and filtering the truth that must be known u can not express ur opinion freely on here and the home and the idea is all a taken idea so I call it a copy paste but I give it a F because the filtering is making my blood boil I want to have a free opinion;
The app is very big crash, full of bugs, but it's good to see Instagram is trying something new fantastic keep it up;
Good;
Lovely üëà‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëåapp;
Worst;
This app was not installing;
Crashes too often;
crashed at least 30 times, every time I try to upload a picture it stops.;
Big like;
To many permission for an app;
I can't umfollow it keeps telling sorry pls try again later ... Please work on this issue;
Put first post on with a few pictures all great. Next day it will let me write a post but not add photos;
Keep getting fail to upload have cleared cache but still not working;
For a brand new, its very well optimized, its like twitterüòò;
Very good threads aap;
So far Because this app is boring like Instagram app Twitter is best;
Very good application;
Nice app . Is it so cute then twitter??????;
I want to like it. But it only let me posts pics for one day before going back to crashing every time I try....;
Best;
Yikes;
Nice app;
I'm loving the app, the only fix i want apart from bug fixes is some control/filter over what we see on our feed. I don't even see the threads by people i follow, and don't wanna see random lame meme pages.;
Nice üëç;
Okay app;
Buggy;
I can't post a picture, why??;
App is good however I wil recommend not to start an account in thread as we don't have an option of deleting just thread account. If we want to delete this account we have delete whole Instagram account which doesn't seems to be perfect way. If you see they are forcing us to stay in this app whatever may come. It's a pure scam. Hence requesting you kindly decided before you start an account. As you can't go back üò¢;
Not bad not bad;
Good app;
Nice app for usage;
Good;
I love this app ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (‚Å†„Éª‚Å†‚àÄ‚Å†„Éª‚Å†);
Wow nice appüî•;
It is a good app and overall good concept but I guess it is better if u add chat option and stories with the new updates. This is just the beginning. I hope we will see good later;
Good;
Great appü•∞;
Overlapping and is threads working in android version;
Amazing;
Downloaded after not working Instagram properly, anyone facing same problem?;
Great to use;
It's pretty good if you have an insta account. There's not too mquch difference from Twitter;
Perfect;
Nice üëç beautiful;
Algorithm for the feed needs a lot of work. I'm seeing the same threads day after day at the top of my feed even if I've seen them half a dozen times already. A lot of random junk I don't care about.;
My Instagram video not playing when I installed üò°üò°;
Hot garbage;
Very dead application not working properly.‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏èüò†üò†üò°;
Not working on redmi note 6 pro. Overlapping text issues on scroll.;
Literally insane ! A good competitor to üê¶ :);
Gooooodd;
Not good like Twitter;
So far so good, app is easy to use, tho it would be nice to be able to choose the photos from their folder instead of scrolling all the way down just to post it in the app;
I say only, it's very nice app Thanks META;
While uploading photos, it keeps getting kicked out of the app, while uploading photos, it shows that the photos are not coming in the form of files or positions, all of them come together, so many problems are faced.;
Wow good app‚ô•Ô∏è;
Wayy better community and content than its competitor (twitter);
Easy to handle easy to use;
Didn't even load on my android device.;
Better than Twitter.;
It's clearly rolled out in a haste, but I appreciate the people who worked on this app. There is no method to add more than one profiles which we can toggle between on Instagram. So if we have 2 profiles on Instagram u can only use one. Hope this will be resolved soon.;
Best platform;
Nice;
Super app;
This is not a high quality app. In this, the post of useless people comes to your home without calling you, picture editing facility is also not available in this.;
Worst app;
Good;
Fix the bugs it's been days and I am not being able to use it;
Not optimized for phones with smaller screens.;
Best app;
1 star because my feed is full of suggested rubbish that I don't want to see just like Facebook and Instagram. I should only see posts from people I follow. Im sick of meta throwing complete nonsense on to our newsfeeds;
My tread having bug/glitch this is why my thread don't work anyway so please check it out and repair it! My Instagram I'd :- abuu.talibb;
Features requests & bugs (so far) : - notification scrolling is very limited - only full gallery is available when looking for a file to attach - no ability to just switch accounts (you have to log out every time) - no dark mode (please for the love of my retinas!);
Wow lovely üåπ;
Very bad;
Good;
Booooring!!!;
Good;
Good;
Why I am having bug?;
Good;
Excellent app, work very smoothly ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç well-done!;
The app scrolls slowly and it does not work properly in dark mode;
Unusable mess, literally cannot read/see anything because of a bug;
How will i change it to dark mode;
Better app from Twitter üòÇüòÇ;
Easy to Use and batter than Twitter i love this app;
glitched, and choppy;
Therads crashed on my phone;
Worst app;
Very nice üëçüëçüôÇ;
Worst app, üò≠ fully glitched screen.;
It's too bad It's not working I don't want to rate it at all;
When I upload images the app crashes;
Awesome, helpfull app. Better than Twitter;
"This app is good but here no option to ""PHOTOS""üñºÔ∏è save in gallery.";
Most informetic app;
I can't understand how to use this app;
Nice;
This is very safe careful and video reel &photo amazing in view app is very nice is future and technology very nice;
Too good üëçüèªüòä;
Why do I see so many irrelevant threads? The feed is a huge mess;
Very good app bro like twitter dad ü•µü•µü•µ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ;
Not impressed;
Wow;
Nice;
the app pop up and bug againüòëplease fix it !;
Perfect!;
Absolutely a very gud app coz many of their acc got hacked so it can help easily to find hackers;
Very bad experience üòî;
What the hell man i can't use threads whenever i scrools it It just skits all the time i can't even read it whats written can't even see what a waste;
Good üëç;
Enjoying Threads;
So far is very nice, but I am hoping to see integration of hashtags like twitter;
If there is a trending section, and a hastags section then it will be alright üëç Overall interesting ü§î;
Buggy app the display is shattering;
Great üëç;
Love it;
Awesome üòç;
The application will not let me create an account, And the easy log in through Google does not work.;
There is a screen glitch in my threads account. Try to solve the glitch (Device:- Redmi note 6 );
Bug fix üòì;
App constantly crashing when trying to comment on threads, also whenever tagging an account it's just crashes straight away. Huawei P20 Pro.;
Wow Excellent;
Very nice apps;
It's just like twitter I guess but the glitchiness is making it almost completely unusable. If I could upload a photo of what it looks like I would. It's headache inducing.;
Won't let you log in without an Instagram account.;
I love this app;
Great twitter alternative, just have no idea why I'm seeing the whole world's posts and not just those posts from people I follow?? I don't want to see posts from those I don't follow, how do I change to see just those posts from people I follow?;
"You can not criticize the app... The level of hypocrisy they are doing in terms of creating a social media app.. if you try to post any post with word ""bug"" or similar it will block you to do.. Better they don't call ita a social media call it restricted media app";
I just tried to upload a picture captured from the camera, but this app keeps crashing.;
Good üëç;
Love it;
Very poor app;
Nice features and easy to use.;
Good app;
Better Than Twitter;
Nice app over all;
Not working at all...app is crashing a lot can't see any posts;
This app not downloaded;
Well I installed the app out of curiosity and it seems interesting but whenever I open the app, it's all glitch. I'm unable to see a single word perfectly and everything is just messed up on screen. Hope you resolve such bugs and issues soon and be able to provide a great user experience.;
Excellent app;
Not bad;
Real buggy. I can't even upload a photo without it crushing. Back to Twitter it is.;
I can't attach a photo. Once I selected from Galary then press ok. The app keep on crashing and just went down. Again and Again same situation. Please fix this frustrating issues.;
It's good but needs more feature updates;
Great!;
I can't post anything on threads. It just closes up. Fix it please;
Sometimes I can post pictures and sometimes it crashes the app. It'll be better when the bugs get worked out for a new app.;
Worst experience, my Instagram account logouts automatically as soon as I login to threads;
Happens to glitch everytime i enter the appüíÄ;
It's glitching everytime I open the app I hope it's fixed soon!;
Easy and smooth like cream;
The app is cool But I couldn't access my photo folders It's a newly launched app, so there's still room for improvement;
It is not working well..it hangs..;
Overall a good experience so far, however could be improved. I have only used it for a day but inability to properly search by topics makes me feel like I see posts which are irrelevant to me than the posts which I can relate to. It would be helpful to have hashtags available but I understand that at the moment, the app is a new launch and still has a lot of development to go through. Hopefully will be able to give five stars in the future.;
Worst app Twitter is better than threads and Twitter is better optimized its run smoothly on my device and on the other hand threads is lagging littlebit in my device copy paste is not the best solution and if you try to uninstall it your Instagram account gonna deactivate i cant even DM my crush;
Uploading photos is always a problem;
Not at all working lots of bugs error while using;
It's okay but, I don't like how pictures appear.. not full size of monitor wigth;
There's no room for mail or chat on thread directly;
Constant app bug;
I love the clean interface and the lack of pointless config however why is my feed filled with people I don't follow??? I've tried the suggested work arounds and they don't work;
I love the idea but recently I've been unable to access my followers list. Keep saying I should try again. Its really hindering the smooth flow I was enjoying for the first few days.;
The app is great but it keep stopping everytime I attach a picture to the thread.;
I like it but it does need some improvements like more private settings like there should be a option to hide my replies from people while having my profile in public simliar to the twitter circle like that;
My homescreen is just a pile of posts from accounts that I don't follow, never heard of, and don't want to see. I'm completely uninterested in all these posts. And there's no way to only see see the accounts you follow--you're forced to see all the junk. Why would anyone intentionally want junkmail?;
This app is terrible. Nothing works correctly, even on a S23 Ultra. Very useless. Not enjoyable whatsoever.;
this app is annoying! i try to delete my account, you cant. i try to remove that number from my bio you can't. this is wrong.. i should able to add and delete apps if i wanted to!!!;
Once I open the app, it starts glitching. I have installed and unistalled 3 times now. I can't even scroll the TimeLine or go to profile.;
Lag;
It's not that bad but there's a little problem in it. I want to edit my bio and import it from Instagram but it keeps saying there's something went wrong. I need help if you read this.;
There is no option to edit typo mistakes. I can't see where to add a video. In fact, I can't see where to add or post anything! Managed it once but don't know how? My icons seem to be missing! Using tablet and tried phone! Doesn't flow for me! I'll wait until it works properly before I invest too much time with it!;
Cannot even log in, just keeps coming up with error, u installed.;
Same poor data collection practices as other Meta apps Battery drains much faster with this app in the background potentially due to larger data collection pool than other apps Lacks lots of engaging features and currently prioritises posts from creators established on Instagram rather than followed accounts;
Great onboarding experience! I already like it way better than Twitter. The app works smoothly and is well-designed.;
App-breaking screen bug where it looks like multiple different screens are all overlaying over each other and you can't see anything. Scroll and it gets 100x worse;
Extremely buggy. I can't even scroll without every screen overlapping on top of each other and creating a mess.;
Liked it until today when it started crashing. Right now, it won't open at all.;
Stagnant Glitches when i scroll the page up and down;
Very nice app I'm enjoying the nice interface;
don't work voice fromvideos ... tap 2 voice button every time;
Needs search, hashtags, some way to curate your feed. It just shows celebrities and influencers, discovery is weird.;
Here to spite Elon lol;
Bad;
Sometimes I load it and it closes down. I cant use it.;
This is a lousy attempt to steal Twitter users but it won't work once people realize all the big name people featured as new users are revealed to be payed for their joining this POS app;
Better than twitter;
Meh, there is a lot of other threads that i have scroll past to find people I follow. Adding those accounts to the block list doesn't diminish the amount of unwanted theads. The plus side is that if you have a pretty extensive sponsored ads block list in IG, that was carried over.;
App lan√ßado de qualquer jeito. Basicamente pegaram a parte de coment√°rios do Instagram e colocaram ali. N√£o tem filtro para poder escolher de quem que tu quer ver as coisas, n√£o tem como ver s√≥ de quem tu segue e toda hora aparece uma postagem de algum comunista falando bobagem. Na pr√°tica, √© um lixo de app. N√£o tem como excluir a conta depois de criar, totalmente em desacordo com a LGPD;
Good app;
Hanya instagram dengan tambahan fitur bisa share link outpost. Perpaduan Twitter+IG+Anggota Fesbuk;
Can you please make it so that we see posts from who we follow instead of everyone and their mother?;
Copy past twitter;
Horrible app, horrible experience. Just a copy of another successful app.;
Very impersonal feeling UI, in it's current state this app feels more like a barebones Instagram copy rather than an extension of it.;
Amazing;
Threads is a son of Twitter;
Cant able to install why its nt working;
Needs some more years to be perfect.;
The only reason I'm giving it a three star is because when you follow people they don't show up on your feed it's a bunch of random users other than that the app itself is pretty cool;
Good;
It's crashing on my phone (motorola z2 force);
Horrible Chinese copy ü§Æü§Æü§Æ;
Following features is useless! I still saw something that I dont wanna see. Should I block every random post? Feels like spam to me. Your algoritm sucks kinda IG and FB. Adopt by twitter, add features between following and recomendation! So You can add ADS on recomendation features!;
This app is great and all, but the one key thing that's missing that's also on Insta is the option to easily switch from one account to another.;
to much bug & glitch;
Crashes when I try to upload a picture;
I went to use;
Can't download pictures?;
Very easy to use;
Great;
While it's not Twit-ler, it's still Meta. I'll give it a spin if only to stick my finger in Elon's eye.;
"Well, So far, I like it.. Still figureing it out..;)";
üòç;
I just installed the app. But when I try to open it it crashes.;
It does not work;
Honestly didn't use it. It would just be funny to watch Elon lose $44 billion.;
It's a Great app;
IG gwcke hack karena ni apps sial!!;
Very useful app;
Do more updates!!;
There's a big glitch problem on interface. But I solved it. When I turn off dark mode app is working normally. But it's not the solution. I don't like the light mode. Please fix this.;
Very ‚Å∂‚Å∂‚Å∑;
Nice;
Big ups;
I like the concept, and it's good to start. However, it needs to be easier to follow people in your feed without opening the post and harder to highlight text. I kept accidentally highlighting while scrolling and clicking on posts when trying to follow someone.;
It's an all-around unsatisfactory experience. I wish it were fully separate from Instagram without requiring an Instagram account.;
This app is not safe, it's literally letting me see people's phone numbers!!! You're being exposed!!!!;
Adakah yang appnya tampilan kayak matrix juga? Nge-hang walau udah diuninstall berapa kali. Apakah karena hpku yang kentang? Tapi aplikasi lain gak ada yang kayak gini nih. Udah daftar akun threads tapi gak bisa dipakeüòå;

It's better than Twitter, and I barely used Twitter.;
Far better than Twitter üëçüòÄ;
It's needs more improvements to look pretty and warm;
I'm currently experiencing a challenge posting threads to my Instagram feeds. I was able to do so this morning with no hassle but of late I only have the option to post to either my IG stories or Twitter. Can anyone assist?;
Please create scheduled content for this app too;
Very boring;
It's just like Twitter but worst since you always get censored.;
threads is good so far but theres a few features it lacks which should be added: - option to bookmark threads - following certain topics so that we can customize our algorithms and homepage other than that its rlly good!;
Bad I got hacked;
Awful twitter ripoff with half the features. To top it off you can't delete account without deleting your instagram. Disaster;
Horrible could not keep app open.;
Great experience;
I might just stick to Twitter;
Full of glitches üò°üëé;
It's all in a language I cannot understand and changing it has not been easy. Just seems like a copy of twitter just not as good. Why would anyone need this when we already have twitter? Why do we need so many social media apps???;
Can't get through the setup process. I want to manually select who of my Insta followers to follow in Threads, and twice now I've spent a fair while going through the list only to have it shut down when I get to the end before I can continue to the next stage. It reverts back to the start, and I have to redo my profile and select everyone again only for the same thing to happen. I don't have time for this.;
Bestie;
Hope elon is proud!;
The only problem I have with this app is you can't choose your username it automatically takes it from your Instagram. I feel like I was early enough to this app where I could finally get the username that I have on YouTube. Or even a username for my band. But I can't because Instagram....;
Copied the form factor of twitter but the functionality is not quite there yet;
Can't use without Instagram account;
When will it be able to get for Kindle Fire? ...I can only get on my phone;
It is very bad app üò†üò† data waste pura app hila hua he;
Threads app is of the best app in the world üåç;
Good;
üëªüëªüëªüëªrubbish app;
I don't want to see threads from people I don't follow;
I love this app and I hope everyone use this app and l am telling you guys threads is amazing we have appreciate this app;
Best of luck ü§û Happy üòä;
I love it ü§©ü§©ü§©;
Good;
App keep crashing whenever I should upload a photo !!! Not a good start for thread !!;
It scrolls so slowly. I think the developers probably forgot that not everyone uses a phone with high refresh rate. It doesn't scroll smoothly like Twitter.;
Too much lagging üòî;
So nice to finally have a good substitute to Twitter. Basically the same but better.;
No feed settings, made for an absolutely terrible experience.;
I want to delete this account without deleting Instagram;
Twitter copy. Totally uninteresting;
Nice üëç;
Nice to meet you and threads in so nice appp;
Honestly this app is till in its testing stage, bugs on top of bugs;
please make threads lite mode;
What is the difference from Instagram and Twitter? Copy paste doesn't solve anything. You should have come up with an innovation. Downloading 100 m + is not a success like me most of them will delete the app and wont use it.;
So boring,same features we got on twitter also .;
laggy;
Good;
Keyboard covers letters on screen when typing. And add edit to typing options for one to easily alter writings with ease.;
Keeps crashing. Myspace would never do this to me.;
Was working fine. This evening it opens, then immediately closes. Glitch appears.;
Woow;
I would really like to be able to use more than one account. I have 2 IG accounts, 1 business and 1 personal, but can only use one on the app on my phone by just switching like on the IG app.;
This app is super kul üéâ;
Sub optimal;
It's very good üòäüíØ;
Required to have Instagram account as well? BS.... regardless if from I-Gram, should'nt be required to have an additional bloatware app.;

Not bad. Its pretty new with room for improvements.;

Overall experience is good but I have facing issues while uploading the photos ,that was very disappointed;
That's great üëç;
The interface is a big problem. Right from the point where a user logins in his or her account; the app feels cluttered.
I want to have it available on my Windows computer;

Great app;
Thank you for open my account;
Not well;
Its wonderful it's just needs a little bit more improvement, like multiple pictures the second time you post because I posted multiple pictures the first time and now I'm unable to post more pictures including just one but I am able to upload videos which I think is weird I am also able to make regular posts with words only;
Twitter wannabe. Would give 0 stars if I could. Uninstalled immediately;
it is Cool!Nice;
According to me this app is good üëçüòä;
Shaz;
üò°ü§¨üëπ;
It's good but has a few kinks. It needs settings like an in-app dark mode instead of it being tied to my phones settings. Along with features like direct messaging. Ads don't seem too intrusive but I'd like to see more in my feed from people I follow;
üòç;
Over all good. Please invest in making a dark mode.;
Lack of free speech, not engaging and the UI is horrible.;
Good, üëç;
Goood;
is there ever going to be a point where you can join this app without having an Instagram?;
Way better than Twitter.;
Good üëç;
This is frud app;
Nice app;
This is a beautiful app;
I have rated one star cuz actually I haven't used it yet , everytime i open the app it lags and it's terrible I can't use it cuz all things are in each others I can't describe anymore about my problem;
The app is crashing i sent 1 star if the bug has been fix I'll change it to 5 star;
Lame;
Mediocre users;
Good every thing needs competition;
Unic and outastending app;
I can't remove my threads id from insta profile.;
Awesome üëåüèº;

it's just twitter without politics and gore videos;
Ad hashtags option plz and trend;
good;
we need a dark mode;
Don't download it.;
please add Edit feature.. it's not user friendly if you have to delete then repost things again.;
What an app just waste of time no sense of using at all just copy of Twitter;

"Don't know how to say about this application. Similar to ""The Blue Bird""ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ but the difference that I found is No direct message and No Hashtag. No direct message is more new approach like whatever you do you says, goes public (but for private accounts goes to your friends and followers) BUT no Hashtag to search the topic we need. That's make me don't know of how to use this application anymore. (Keep it don't delete it people say it could affect Instagram's account. ü§£ü§£ü§£";

Accidently leave the app when writing a stitch? Gone! Forever! You're better off writing it in you own notes first. Want to see stitches of the people you follow? Good luck.;
App keeps crashing, hoping for a fix asap :);
GOOD MORNING;

Good, but it would be nice if there was a save feature so I can save a post if I want and I don't want to see posts in my feed of people or organizations I don't follow;
This is a very good app;

The concept of the app is good. But the app needs some optimization. There are some glitches in the app And it's draining my device's battery. So after some times, I need to fixed my battery issues. Make threads more compatible. Please fixed this problems as soon as possible.;

cheap copy of twitter;
I can't even open a page properly I just installed it andbits glitching;
Good man....;
I don't see a point in this app. 1) I can't search for a specific post based on keywords. Or related topics 2) cannot know what is happening locally because there is no location based trends. 3) I don't understand the feed. It has nothing that I'm interested. I don't know why I'm asked to view those posts. 4) I cannot use the app to DM anybody.;

I'm still learning why I need the app & how I can make it work for me... Haven't found my identity yet... However... Sometimes while leaving a thread of my own or commenting on someone else', I'll be randomly kicked out, as if I touched my minimize button, (which I haven't) & it's gone out of the post I was in & cleared what I typed. Most times I would loose the post completely... You can imagine how frustrating this is! 10 July, I had to re-type my own thread 4 times, as I kept being kicked out;
Nice aap;

It good and easy to use üòå;
Please follow;
SUCH A POLITICAL APPLICATION META.;
Nice;
I downloaded a game about a button and the button game went off my phone faster. This is literally Twitter except empty because no one is using it yet so start a thread so this app can have text;
I know it's still messy. But, hopefully we can get a tl/nf thing where we can only see mutuals or threads we follow.;
It is very good ...... ........ ..;
RTL languages isn't supported properly unlike IOS. Text will always align as LTR whenever there is an English word, even if you started typing with an RTL language.;
Chaos on screen .. messages are overlapping to each other, unreadable.. bad bad apps.. still a billion mile away from twitter..;
Whitout instagram I can't login in this app It worst to use ü§¨ü§¨;
Nice app monitaiiz Walla app sahiye;
Can not make a 1st time account, it just ask me to sign in using Instagram that I do not have on my phone, SO HOW TO MAKE A ACCOUNT?????;
The first few days it worked well until today. The app keeps shutting down & fails to open. Disappointed;
Very good and # add please;

Threads login should be changed , it should be available for non Instagram users....;
Enjoying the thread based communication, however experienced lessened by frequent crashes;
Bad app;
Not having the ability to delete the account, this app is very dangerous and do not install it at all;

Not working this app;
Thread has a very unique design, just simple. I wish to have more fun with this app üòä;
Worst app;
Nice üëçüôÇ;
Good but they shd add more features to surpass Twitter. So I like to request Mark Zuckerberg & his team to pls add these features.üëá 1. Should show no. of impression(views) in each post. 2. It should Show trending hashtags, # should work. 3. Theme should be impressive. 4. There should be inbox section to message privately. 5. It should show both followers & following on the profile. 6. There should be EDIT Button in every post. 7. Must add Poll section for voting. 8. Live Video should be there.;
BETTER THAN TWITTER TBHüíÄ;
Good but should have a following and a dark mode.;
Amazing!;
Why you guys don't fix it's bugs when I first time downloaded it,it's login went good and then when I scroll it things are getting overlaped, I was not able to see a word , I deleted it and downloaded it again but the same problem occurs all the time , fix it as soon as possible;
Copied cat zukko for a Twitter app #ccopied cat;
No option fo create account. I don't use Instagram so they force to use Instagram.;

Oh üò±üò± amazing aap üòäüòäüòä;
Hate that I cant delete my threads account without also deleting my instagram account;
It's way better than Twitter!;
It's a better application for news and updates....good for students;
üôÇ;
Like most people are saying, the app is decent. It does need more features. You can't save photos or videos from your feed. It also needs a view media only mode. I believe that eventually everybody will migrate from Twitter over to this app, once the updates & new features come in.;
Same as twitter;
Simply will turn out to be the best in less than 1 month;
Elon Mask is my boss. He forced me to give 0 rating.;
The app is cool;
It's Two good for me;
I don't really see a purpose of this if you already have IG and Twitter. It's a complete bite of Twitter and just another step for Meta to dominate our data and lives.;
Good üëçüòäüéâ;
Nice interface, Hope doesn't change your mind in interface in other update .üôÇ;
"""Rusnya""";
Waooow;
My experience was worst I didn't even wanna give 1 star because whenever I open it there are so many glitchs and we click one thing but we see it's multiple selfs and it's running automatically;
Absolute rubbish, censorship worse thein in nazi Germany. Working to spread russian propaganda and if you post something from real world got banned not only from here but also on joined meta accounts.;
A download image feature would help massively also the search bar needs to improved to the users interests;
Copy for Twitter;
Follow me;

Lol, experiencing using this apps, and couldn‚Äôt getting code.;

Kinda look like Twitter or maybe i'm wrong, and Threads has no advertisment so i think it's great anyway.;
Story dalne ka to do ismein;
Your app is good, almost perfect. We aldo need a place to chat with our followers like Instagram. Please we need it. Thanks Zukky;
Deletes instagram account also if someone wants yo delete threads account only;
am just addicted to that app, looking promissing and fancy!!;
I'm not able to deactivate my account. When I click on deactivate, I'm immediately logged out of my account. But the case is it's still visible to my friends and to check I tried to log in back immediately and my account was logged in which means that my account is not deactivated, if it was then I would not be able to log in back immediately. I request you kindly look into this matter and do something about this immediately. Also I faced the same issue with Instagram sadly.;

- News feed too random, no meaning for follow my friends, random for what? - no hashtags system - can't using on PC but IG can (like need download app counts more than response user) - reduced video clip quality - cannot search for my media post from pass but twitter can - cannot draft the post - cannot change to the dark mode - no DM Good bye üëã;

Cool app;

Ok;
Why this app?;
Nothing in front of Twitter, Twitter is the best. I love twitter;
Needs improvement and speed.;
Impossible to use. It gets loaded with pics and text layered on each other infinite number of times and my whole screen turns into a mess. Guess it is not optimized or something. This is the only app that gives me such an issue, and Instagram itself works fine.;
love it and hate it so much at the same time coz we can't just go into gallery from threads suppose i wnat to pin a pic in someones thread i select pin and it just shows all pics from recent we have no option to select from gallery like in other apps we just have to keep scrolling 10000 of pics till we find the pic to pin in....plz let us open gallery our gallery from threads....its really annoying....;
good;
Good App ... ü§çü§çü§ç;
Agar aapka Instagram account nahi hai to aap ismain log in nahi kar sakte. Pls iska solution karein kyu ki Instagram nahi chalata.;
please don't use threads app only use twitter;

It has minimal UI and a typical user flow. There is a bug, though. When I try to upload images in the following thread, it shuts. I tried removing from recents, reinstalled, but stayed the same.;
ü•± another Zuckerberg data swiper;

Great app. Great potential. Great additions would be a following only feed & a DM system that's integrated with messenger & instagram DMs. A better followers & following system is also needed.;
Good;

This is a good app provide with fast information and have many more features then Twitter I am using Twitter for many years but it does not give any social media vibes;
I like this;
Good Application;

Not many data is present people just use it as a next gen Instagram that's only but Twitter have many database and easy to use very good features in Twitter threads is very very lack of data compared to twitter;

Not working, as soon i touch ut to scroll it a little, it washes the screen with words like when you scroll very fast and never stops just have to close the app then.;
Love what I see so far. I missed the Instagram craze when it first came out so I was very late to the game. I definitely think Threads will be the social media platform of the future. So I won't be late this time.;
Me rate this product but me no use this application because social media in Hilight this application.;
Very bad I install it 2 times but still glitch please fix the glitch screen bug;
Don't have built in dark mode and scroll is also to much laggy for me;
Nice app;
It's an imitation of Twitter. Too bad don't try it;
Okay app for now. It can be better of course, but time will show.;
I don't know but when I open the app it starts glitching.;

Too invasive! This isn't the 1st time #ThreadsApp has failed. It's been around since at least 2019 when it tried to rival #Snapchat & it failed miserably. #Zuckerberg is a joke who can't even come up w/his own original ideas. He just clones & steals others work! Can't wait till it fails again;
It's a good and interesting app but this app is child of Instagram üòÇ;

Very easy to use better than twitter you can share with any one and you log in with your instagram you open the app and you see your account on instagram you click it and you just log in and when you open on you instagram profile you see threads picture and anumber behind it the number is your turn of installing threads easist and best app in 2023;

Nice app . Firstly we actually needed replacement of Twitter and you guys did it perfectly , your growth proves this.;
I know development is still in works but i'm confident that i wouls not like to see suggestions in my feed/ Timeline. If the app must do this, i suggest there be a toggle button that actuall works to turn off suggestions. Other concerns arent as annoying.;

Trash Trash Trash!!! Let us delete this app! Holding us hostage by linking it to our Instagram page.;
I'm grateful that someone has created an alternative to the mess that Twitter has become, and Threads is looking promising. It's early days yet, so I expect changes, but the App desperately needs the ability to show Threads from people I subscribe to, and in chronological order of their posts. The interface is clear-ish but definitely needs work. No ads yet! Unfortunately, I've been followed by 'Sexy Susan' who has zero followers and a risque profile pic so I think the bots are active already.;

Wah;
Not a fan, seemed decent at first but I don't want to be spammed with accounts I don't follow. They fixed the deactivate so it doesn't mess with IG, so that function works.;

Still early for this app, but I look forward for some cool updates;

the application looks nice from the outside and from the inside, but there are some hiccups you have in it, such as it doesn't have personal conversations, Twitter and Instagram And I searched for a theme in black when I find until now that it has another theme other than the white color and this does not suit people's thinking most of the time Dear Mark, Verify my personal account on Threads for free and you will be very grateful because I do not have the Enough money verify it by myself Thanks;

"Great App! Loved it from the very first day although I have the following challenges; 1. My keyboard does not stack with the UI page, it covers it and so I can't see what I'm typing. 2. Can't save images like every other user. 3. From 100+, Can't see the latest follower as an individual to see their profile; have to search. 4. UI gets a little confusing sometimes as there's no proper demarcation between one thread on my timeline and another. 5. Opening some threads crashes the app occasionally.";
Just lost all the excitement of using this app...for last 24 hrs I can't load posts or comment on a threads. I tried reinstalling, clear cache nothing works. Best I can do is view and like that's it. So frustrating;

I expected this app made by Meta as a competitor to Twitter be well thought out and mostly finished. Nope, it's like a modern video game release. Release a cobbled together alpha stage product and then make it usable after months or years. There should be a feed that only shows your subscriptions but nope, there's one feed and it shows everyone and you can't filter out content you don't like. I was constantly being flooded with sports, rappers, and christians... absolutely disgusting.;

Love the concept of the app but I can't post anything without the app closing down! Very frustrating!;
Worst app deleting this also delete Instagram üò≠üò§;
Nice app;
Do NOT download this app. This is bloatware and once you go to uninstall it, you will have to delete your Instagram account as well. Basically, it's a trap created by Mark Zuckerberg.;
ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤Ÿá;
Not entertainment this app.. Not story's not like & retweet cound exr....;
ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤;
Got app but it kept closing and refused me to set up an account no mater what I tried the app flagged me and that made no sense! I found another way and off I was made one post will wait and see if it gets noticed. As far as Facebook I don't use it much but probably more than I with threads will wait and see if they actually flag me for my one post ? Surprise surprise I finally decided to do a thread post and bam it never posted I didn't like Facebook much hate Twitter being run by Elon Musk.;
Useless;

Not deserving even 1 star. Worst experience.;
There is no trending option for knowing latest trending things;

Great news feed. I hate Twitter. Thank you for a great alternative;
Really loving the app so far, but there is a serious issue with watching video clips where when I click the unmute audio button the video will just stop playing and freeze frame.;
It's not good It's like fully shaking Please check mine and clear it for mee;
Ok;
As soon I opened the Application, it started acting like weird.;
Worst app everüëéüèª;
Hello World..Hello sir, I have just downloaded this app and I don't know how it works.;
Please add dark mode to it;
Op;
I think it‚Äôs not bad.üôÇ;
Super;
Is this app crash in my phone;
Better experience but.;
It is an app only to steal data, it is useless and when deleting the account it only deactivates it but the number continues to appear on the instagram profile;
This app seriously needs a FYP and hashtags, getting sick of only seeing posts of people I follow;
Nice;
Follow me;
Got more bugs than a termite infested building;
Forces you to use Instagram;

Very basic. Third rate Twitter knock off. Just get Twitter.;
I think this is good app;

There's a glitch in the app. Pages are overlapping. Tries every possible aspect to resolve the issue by re-installing, clearing cache & data but still unable to use the application properly. Very disappointing. Finally, uninstalled the application as for now. Whenever the app will improve, will download it again. Till then using that old Twitter.;
hello sir this app so very good support my account ‚ù§Ô∏è;

The application needs a lot of updates. Also, it is bad. When deleting the account, it deletes the Instagram account with it. I hope to amend and thank you;

Good;
Overall, it's fine for a quick social media fix. No curation though. One thing that's weird is that at least for me, on Android, there is no chat or DM feature of any kind. Kinda weird for an app named after the late IG messenger app...;
Too Lag...;
Please add a switch account feature. Also, save images and download videos;
Kuch khaas mhi hak;

Nice üëç;
It's a good idea, but completely useless at present. What's the point of following people if my feed is flooded with people I don't follow?;
I like this app very much...but last night it kicked me out. Everything I try to get back in, it does it again...its frustrating and I don't know if its ever going to let me in.;
How to verify threads?;

Great app... but some things need fixing. The app crashes anytime I try to upload a photo, probably 10mb or higher. Plus, the quite disorganised feed. Asides that great app and competition for Twitter;

It's more like Facebook, in my opinion, but it doesn't allow for hashtags or topic searches. I prefer Twitter, most def. I want to delete it, but the app does not allow account deletion without also deleting my Instagram. Not happy with the app at all, really.;

Well I downloaded the app only to find out afterwards that you have to have a Instagram account to log in, and there's no other way around that that I saw, so 1 star. If it's fixed, then I will re-review. I don't have Instagram and I'm not getting it either.;

The app is good, but the app is unnecessary. With a/an Facebook/Instagram/Twitter previously in use, I find minimal usage for a [new] version of the same apps. Also... you will delete your personal IG account when you delete Threads, which is not only redundant, but a directly violation of my intellectual rights, and there is no NDA, MOU/MOA, or any other contractual agreements within the terms and agreements, prior to you logging in, and/or your account being pre-setup by the [app], itself.;

this app litterary cracks and shakes like my screen has got issues but it doesn't if it did i would not be commenting on this app peacefully pls can this issue be fixed;
Firstly, I want to express my appreciation for the overall concept of Threads. It provides a convenient and private platform for sharing updates, photos, and videos with close friends. However, the integration of the Reels feature within the app has caused some inconvenience and cluttered the user experience.Separating the Reels section within the app would greatly enhance the user experience. It would allow for improved focus, easier navigation, enhanced privacy, and a streamlined interface;
There is no option to delete your account unless you delete Instagram It's privacy nightmare the app collect everything all my data on my phone I don't feel safe and there is nothing I can do about it It was trap for me to download this app and i fall in it;

I've deleted both apps multiple times and restated my phone, worked for a little but now back to how I mentioned. A real pain, I've sent complaints but nothing yet.";
I don't normally write reviews but I'm so annoyed with this app! I've tried to share a picture about 10 times, both by sharing from my gallery and directly uploading to the app and it's not working. I've tried updating the app and when that didn't work, uninstalling and reinstalling. I'm at a loss. Very frustrating.;
Random people appears on my HOME. Seriously?;
Ngl this app is a lot more addicting. I've never used Twitter but this is way better;
Why do I have to make an Instagram account just to use this app?!;
Needs some tweaks but it's way more acceptable than that mess Elon made of Twitter.;
One needs an Instagram account - Buuuuuhhhh.;
Thank you for invading our privacy üëéüëéüëé Hey viewer try checking which kind of data Threads is collecting before installing... I am sure you'll hate it immediately.;
An impressive piece of Spyware that's good at circumventing firewalls. Another app you'll want a separate phone for. Aggregate accounts and corporate shills are what ruined Instagram as a platform, and Threads is a celebration of those things. A great app for stalkers and law enforcement in states where abortion and being gay or trans is illegal.;
üå∫üôèüå∫;
There is no point in using this app, Not good for getting valid news, Not good for entertainment ... Twitter is way better;
an extremely bland rip-off of twitter. there's a lacking of something but i can't quite pinpoint what it is;
Very excellent;
Great app, was never on Twitter but Threads has me hooked;
So much good;
Meh;
I genuinely like the Threads app. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of some features i feel the app needs. Trending topics should have been there from the premiere. Also DMs, even if it's a button that links us to Instagram DM to complete the conversation. The app could also use the Spaces function. Overall, Threads is amazing.;
Worse;
this app is really bad the ui is not user friendly I couldn't understand anything;
You stole this app;
Easy to use and responsive. Loved the interface;
It's good üëçüèº;
This app is copy by Twitter;
Okay so far needs to fix some issues. I'm sure they are already hearing about all of the features that are missing but I'm actually having issues with gif uploads. When I upload a gif it glitches bad, turns it green and purple with 4 overlays of the same gif;
It is a very good app;
The app is good but i think there should be an option for pinning threads on a person's profile and also the time that feed takes to load is slow;
Nice app üëçüëç;
Not what I expected.. with that being said I was informed if I delete the app my Instagram gets deleted as well. Why would you do that.. not a fan of it, it's complicated if you ask me. Disappointing;
Why theres no threads listed in social links platform in facebook? I suggest you include threads so that you can share your threads acc link in your timeline. Thank you.;
Not bad. It's a hybrid of Instagram and Twitter. So far so good, interested to see the reputation this app builds.;
Censorship is the name of the game.;
The app, I think, is cool. It still needs work. I wish when you're about to post a picture there was a way to choose what gallery album to go into. It gets annoying having to scroll through all my pictures to find what I need.;
I think it's just a copy of Twitter I thought it's gonna be special and better but it's worse actually.;
Nice New social media app. I'm really loving this.;
Unable to create an account;
This has potential. Still needs some updates to make it usable fulltime. Needs: -Following only feed in chronological order -Start feed where you last read, current feed jumps to top -Allow third party apps access Do that and I'm done with Twitter forever;
Clean experience;
Fascinating app;
I really like it! Easy to use. Converts instagram following & followers instantly too.;
it works;
App is bugged can't see anything;
Woh;
No save button;
the worst I don't like it at all;

Its twitter bro dont use this app ita just for wasting time;
I was really enjoying Threads until today, yes it definitely needs work with the feed and following but over time that will improve I'm sure. However, as of an hour ago, everytime I try to reply to a thread, it crashes as soon as I type the first letter? Hope you fix this ASAP! I really don't want to go back to Twitter! üò≠ Update! Started working again after I posted this review! ü§£ Fingers crossed it keeps that way ‚ò∫ Further update! Same stupid crashing issue when trying to reply, grrr üò°;
App like giving bamboo behind Twitter;
A) we need a character count B) we need hashtags to actually work C) we need to be able to pin a post to the top of our profile. D) we need to be able to save media. Everyone shares and saves media. Wtheck. E) also we can't mute accounts? Sorry but I don't wanna block every single person out there. I use this for one thing and one thing only. And because it's new there are THOUSANDS of ppl idk showing up on my feed. Sorry but this won't ever replace twitter. ü§£ü§£;
Wow this app is the best.everybody feels related,it's such a close community.just wish it had more features.;
Bestüëçüëçüëç;
F Elon honestly lol;
Facebook, ew;
Very nice so much;
Clean UI;
Keep respect Twitter;
Wow;
Thanks Meta üî•üî•üî•;
Nothing new for obviously reasons. It's missed a big feature from the other: anonymity. People liked the other cause they could be someone else, a fun username and share random thoughts, far from real life people, so... Some people said that if your ig is on dark mode, than threads will also be. My ig is on dark mode and yet threads is on light. Would be better if this setting was a part, just add dark mode button on threads.Also you can't delete the account unless you delete your ig account.;
The app works well and I like it so far, but it's missing a few things, like a section for my liked post or bookmarks so I can revisit them. Don't know why they were left out since IG already has them.;
Nice;
It is a great site for keeping up with the latest news from top journalists. Also, it is not a cesspool of white supremacy and hate as opposed to the dying bird site.;
For a new app it's great. But, it lacks dark mode which I and several people want/need. I know that they will be adding it, but the home page doesn't show who I'm following half the time and instead is showing other people I have little to no interest in. As well as this, the lack of tags seems to be a problem if it's not added soon. Other then that, a very good start and already better then Twitter.;
Not good.;
Excellent;
T&C's are outrageous! My gender, sexual orientation, and my browsing history?;
Seems much better!;
No ads (yet).;
my app is crashing, always shaging when i try to scroll the app, i think it is a bug. will change my rating when already fixed;

Horrible Twitter Knockoff;
Excellent;
Good app;
Cut and paste from Twitter, nothing new, we need fresh ideas;
The user experience so far so good, clean and neat, and easy to navigate through, my biggest problem with it, that there's no Dark Mode so far, and the people following you can easily find and follow you back, which is a thing that I should choose instead of the system choosing it for me, I acknowledge it's an Instagram App, but when it to comes to the user choice, it's better to let the following stuff up the users themselves, not automatically you find the same list migrating to threads..;
üí©;
Super this is very useful for Instagram and secure safetyü§ûüëèüëèüëè;
Very good app;
Amazing app;
Wrost;
Bit buggy on android 9 device, after reloading threads layout seems overlaping each other;
Good app . However on thing we request is to have the translation there. Not all of us read a particular language . If have I will change mine to at least a four star for now;
New and the best app..;
Good app;
Easy to use, better than Twitter;
App logout ing everytime;
Copy of Twitter and tracks twice the personal information;
Almost two hours of background usage on a day I used this app at most 5 minutes, same happens frequently with Facebook and Instagram so I end up switching the to Restricted Background Usage... Meta data collection is really intensive apparently.;
Always bugs, log out many time.;
There is nothing new. Everything is copy of Twitter. This is not fair.;
Better than Twitter for the most part. Need a chronological following only feed.;
nice;
Bad;
It's Really uselessüëÄ;

I do hope they could add translator to fans that are international, hard to read some threads that aren't the same language that I use :')) But overall, the app is good :));
Awesome and worth supporting;
It's refreshing to be somewhere not [insert rival app here], but the app needs work: 1) Chrono order timeline (seeing the same non-followed accounts is boring). 2) In addition, if you want to stick w/ the current timeline (For You), fine, but give us a Following timeline as well. 3) For brands/social media managers that work on multiple accounts, please implement an easier way to switch accounts than having to log out then log in (it gets annoying). 4) Please add a way to schedule posts. Thanks!;
very good app;
Best;
Nice;
I have never used Twitter so I can't compare but man it is annoying that 90% of my thread is full of stuff I didn't ask to see.;

Get ready to take your chatting game to the next level with this application. Instagram, is the greatest platform where billions of individuals from all corners of the globe come together to connect, share, and inspire through attracting photos and videos.  Threads!  is like Instagram but for text! Can you believe it?ü•∞;

Hey Creator, Is there any problem with threads it's not running in my phone! The homepage of thread buffers and all the texts, posts etc overlap each other. I have tried all the possible things like reinstalling, rebooting my phone, etc. Please try to fix the bugs. Thank you!!;
Pues quiero eliminar la cuenta y no quiero eliminar mi Instagram. Pero lo har√© si es necesario.;
We did not need a new time wasting app;

Good but i am Og fan of Twitter;
Nice one;
Threads > üê¶;
I dont know why, but i could imagine your logo to be rainbow line (matching instagram) on black instead of white line on black background.. but white on black is pretty too‚ò∫Ô∏è;
Not working while uploading images.;
Breath of fresh Air! I never knew just HOW toxic the other app had gotten until I switched to Threads. It's only been a week and everyday it gets better and better.;
Plzz don't dwnld the app;
""" Most Excellent App By Threads """;
Faaltu;
Why its connected with Instagram.. i installed it and open account from insta. Now this thread badge is shown up in insta's bio. I Removed it many times from there..but its again shown on page refresh. Please do this app independently from insta...or i uninstall both the app..üôÇ;
Love;
Congratulations üëèüéâ;
Have to have an Instagram for it, it's not a separate thing.;
This is batter than Twitter;
Please know that if u download this app once and link it with ur insta then cant delete it id u delete ur insta id will also be permanently deleted;
I love this app ‚ù§‚ù§;
Usefull App;
Thik h;
The only thing I don't like so far is the fact that we can see people we do follow reply to people we don't and theirs no option to turn it off;
Good;
Why do I have everything on my feed here? Content and pages I don't even follow? How do I control what I don't like and want on my feed?;

I found a error occurred in download the app, it was downloaded till 97% then it is not continues. What can I do;
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§;
The videos stop playing once I unmute the sound. I'm not sure why but other than that, it's a cool app I guess.;
Ek no.;

Very very usefull appü•∞;
a fantastic app;
All I see is random posts curated by Algorithms... I would really appreciate an option just to stick to the posts of the people I follow. Otherwise, why bother with follow button, it's taking forever to locate their posts.;

Would rate 0 stars, insane to not disclose that this will become permanently attached to your Instagram account. Wish I'd never downloaded.;
Nobody asked for this;
i love threads ‚ú®üñ§;
Super;
i love it sm, please make this app a safe place. Also,please include making following 'private' and feeds for 'following' only and not from strangers.;
AWESOME APP;
Not bad for an initial launch. Looking forward to future versions, and hopefully a web interface that allows posting. Needs a lot of work, but will probably exceed Twitter's features and eventually popularity.;
Installed to check it out, saw there was no way to filter by people you follow (seriously, that's a pretty basic feature). Super bare bones imo and really no different from Twitter and that includes the toxicity. I stick with Mastodon and the fediverse.;
This is a best app;
This app was very interested app use the Twitter app;
The best Social Platform;
Omg this app needs so many permissions to run. Scary;
This is likely the most overhyped program in the history of forever. The news feed desperately needs filters and there's just not a lot of organization or structure to it. It's basically just a reformatted version of Facebook.;
App got an update and fixed everything.;
Not download search YouTube ü§¶ü§¶;
Very good for social;
App looks good but it's unfinished.I can't download pics no # . Like button should be on right or at least can change left or right . Meta just rush it out cuz they wanna be the first to rival with Twitter.Still need a lot to do and I don't think this will beat Twitter cuz main reason people use Twitter is because nsfw content.Thread should at least allow nsfw content and give user whether they wanna hide it or not.Its not that difficult,other social media app have it.;
I hope this app Twitter Copy. And instagram and Twitter mixing ... I hope batter;
One of the best app;
Worst experience;
Good;
nice app but it need to add save post option and add save pictures to galary or download it;
not good;
Trash, I got to have an Instagram? I never used that pedophile trash app!;

it was good at first but as long as you use it often, it suspends both your Instagram and threads account;
Nothing productive just celebraties posting their story waste of time, Twitter is far better;
very slow and hanging always. could have been better. but having intial launch app it should be better launch with mote adoption and smooth. and not hanging. already disappointed .;

I am getting regular many followers but I didn't talk anyone's person. So I would like to request you meta team please find the problem of direct message features and try to solve as soon as possible. üôèüôèüôè;
Few features such as being able to add own comment when reposting, being able to control what to be shown in news feed(at least the type of content) and some other features are needed which give more ability to the user to decide what information to consume and what not would be very helpful;
I regret buying Huawei phone, it has its own apps and doesn't allow you to download important ones üò°;
When we delete the thread, then the Instagram account should not be deleted.;
Guys ! Read thread policies. When deactivate or delete thread account then Instagram account also deactivate or Delete... Please be careful & read policies;
Good Threads;
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT TWITTER WITHOUT TELLING ME YOU'RE NOT TWITTER.;
Wait. I can only get it on my phone, and I must have an Instagram account to use it. Really?;
A lack luster, feature deficit, copy cat attempt of liberal stank feces.;
I really hope Threads make a traslate button bottom of the each thread text like twitter, if like that many non english user like me will use this app 100 times more, I hope read english thread more without copy and paste the text to translate app;

Meta trying to make his Twitter is a failure, the only thing that makes them especial is the overcontrol in the privacy and the banning, and that sucks;
There is no practical difference in threads and Instagram. And I mostly see updates from people i don't follow.;

Doesn't allow to remove it's account. & It's badge from Instagram is also not removing. This is not even close to twitter. Trash app!!;
When they first revealed the app, we thought it had potential. But it took only 5 minutes to see that.... NO. It's really just Instagram for tweet-like texts, and, like Instagram, it shows random people all the time. It really doesn't try to do what Twitter does, it's just Instagram;

All you 1stars, give it time. It's a fresh app that isn't trying to do it all. Lead devs interact with users and have explained what's to come. It's fine if you want the X Corp app where every feature breaks on launch but much of what you want is coming - personalized TL, search, etc. Don't get me wrong Meta is sinister but they know how to build an app.;

Such a waste! I don't think we need Threads. It has absolutely nothing to offer. Instagram is more than enough. It's just a weaker version of an ordinary social media app. Want to delete my account but that will instantly delete my Instagram account too. That's very bad and cheap tactics. I'm very disappointed. Shall delete my Instagram too.;

He was named the Person of the Year by Time magazine in 2010, the same year when Facebook eclipsed more than half a billion users.[3][4][5] In December 2016;
There wasn't any need of half cooked app in hurry to compete twitter since app is lacking in loads of basic features. Hope devs are working hard to add features as well as troubleshooting the bugs.;

It could be a good app if it's feed was better. It shows more people I don't follow than I follow with no way to filter it. The last time I opened the app, it showed a rather profane post from an account I do not follow. So I deleted the app. I like regular Instagram a whole lot better.;
no translation option and no chats. Please add these features .a lot of blue check accs in the home that are not in my interests .;

This has potential but the app functions like it was designed by people who have never used social media. I lost count of how many features are missing. It's so limited for an app designed by a billion dollar tech company. It seems as though it was prematurely released to appease shareholders. It's very messy. I also don't like all the censoring taking place. Unless it's blatant hate speech no one should be censored. Let people discuss differing opinions and fix your app.;

I was excited for the app but once it is loaded, I could not even use this app because it started acting weird. All pages are overlapping each other. I can't even interact with anything because as soon as I do, the page starts to behave like a bug. I tried to reinstall but it didn't fix the issue.;
There is no way to limit all the trash coming into the feed. Rubbish. Twitter may be a cesspool but atleadt you can limit it.;

Not a bad app (it runs smoothly and interfaces well with Instagram) but definitely could be improved. The home page is flooded with completely untailored posts that have nothing to do with any of the accounts I follow. Without tags it is hard to find new accounts to follow based on what I am interest unless the keyword is in their username.;
"There are limited features as compared to Twitter, which is what it's trying to be, but overall, it isn't poorly designed frankly wish there was more of a ""recommended"" feed or other features akin to twitter that goes beyond who you follow on instagram.

Love the interface, it's clean and easy on the eyes.;
It's a new trending app ..it's good but I think that there is something you should fix it... like there is no conversation feature... sometimes it's lack when you scrolling ...in settings there should be set dark theme...if you have android version 10 or you have iOS 14 latest version then you can enable dark theme if you don't have you can't....but it is not so bad not so good...üòÉ;

Data collection is massive. Breach of privacy.. worst.;
This version would be decent if we were talking about a beta, but it is the final version and it lacks many QoL improvements. There is no option to see only the threads of people you follow in chronological order, can't use hashtags, the algorithm doesn't take into account the profiles you follow or interact with and recommends anything, cannot perform keyword searches, some videos don't play audio, and many more bugs and non-existing options that should have been there in the first place.;
Following back = permanently disabled account?! Forget this app. Apparently if you follow back too many people that have followed you threads will suspend you. Then you go through the appeal process, including submitting a selfie with all your info they ask for plus a one time code and then threads permanently disables the account. Forget Threads. What a waste of time.;

Since this app is linked to Instagram, it's not possible to use a new user name, but the user name you have already setup on Instagram, which is pointless for a new app. I wanted to create a new user name, but it's not possible here sadly.

Why cant i see only those i follow? Why do i have to see the world? Please can you add a feature that allows mw to only see threads from those i follow;
I don't understand what is app? There's nothing. I removed it after 10 min.;
Good;
Bad Twitter knockoff;
worst than twiter And also all our personal information was absorbed;
Great app fast work app I got verified;
Good üëç;
Bad copy;
I love it;
good;
Twiter copy;
So lazy application i dont like;
Very bad app for the the personal data privacy;
It's ok about app but please separate from Instagram because not everyone's choice to connect thread with instagram.2nd thing is delete thread account it also delete Instagram account which is not fare with us.So kindly solve this problem.Otherwise thread is a very good app.And kindly can you reply if without deactivated thread account uninstall this app what happened? If you separate Instagram from thread more and more people will happy and they can use this app without any fear.This may help;
üòéüëä;
Love you and your family and friends is Stan 59 and share photos;
Been on here 2 hours, but there are bugs like, LOTS OF BUGS. threads failing to upload mostly.;
Great App;
Just download it to give a 1 star, fxxk you mark Zuckerberg alien;
Hard to find the people you follow as it just gives you hundreds of random posts.;
I have not been able to download the application.it stopped when it reached 99%.;
It's so nice;
same algorithms, same content so nothing new. when all meta use same algorithms across their social media what's the point of adding another.;
Lacking a lot of features and functionality, so the user experience is currently far inferior to Twitter. Really only useful to people who have a large following on Instagram, the growth potential for smaller accounts is virtually non existent. Nice clean UI tho;
‡¥®‡µà‡¥∏‡µç;
Bakwas;
It ain't working on my phone......üò°üò°üò°üò°;
A great start, but it needs lots of improvements. Only being able to see posts by followers on your feed for one, an option to edit pictures and videos before you post them, it's also common for the app to crash while trying to upload pictures and videos.;
Good;
This is app very best aap ü•∞;
Good for all;
has lots of potential! people are complaining that its missing aome basic features, which it is. but they were mostly focusing on making sure the app runs smoothly, which it does. has almost completely replaced taitter for me already and with some good quality of life upgrades it can be much better than twitter;
Meta and Twitters primary goal is to sow discord in the world and to brainwash. If you want to fall into that trap, then please download this app.;
Keeps crashing when I'm typing a reply to anything. Very frustrating;
"App doesn't work. Enter username and password and get ""something went wrong, please try again"". Can't do anything or see anything other than this message.";
Trending;
Not it. Be original;
It has a bug so it doesn't works for me, I can't see anything;
We need a save button for videos and pictures;
Not Twitter!;
Some of us do not want to use Instagram. Why is it necessary to access Threads via Instagram? Why there is no alternative registration/login without Instagram?;
Very good for a first release, and bugs are being fixed noticeably quickly.;
Can't see any use of the apo.;
Garbage;
Nice app;
Great app ‚ù§;
Nice app , thanks Zuck;
Good app but it needs more features;
Copy paste;
Can't log on without instagram acct;
Anything but tweeter is a good thing;
Zuck is a cuck;
Good Apps;
I'm really happy with this app;

Lacks real substance compared to the app it's imitating to be. You have to be a self loathing troglodyte to want anything to do with this.;
King always king;
"Every positive review you see that only says ""Great app! 5 stars!"" Or ""Love it"" etc is actually just a paid for bot account out of China or India. Zuckerbucks is a tool and buys and sells your data with every facebook/Instagram/threads profile you use. Just....don't. Wake up people!";
Wow;
Closes the app in the middle of typing or to post.;
Very boring application, poor rehash of twitter;
⁄©€åÿ±€å ÿßŸÜÿØ ÿ¨ÿß⁄©ÿ¥ÿßŸÜŸá;
It's a wonderful app;
I'd really love to be able to save posts. It's a great feature from Twitter and I think Threads should have it.;
Downloaded and linked an account from Instagram and the threads app caused my Instagram app to crash within seconds every time I tried to open the app. Uninstalling the threads app fixed all the Instagram issues I was having. Wild considering it's all one metamess, you'd think it would play together well...;
Data collection practices stop me downloading this App.;
Experienced a bug that made the app unusable, while scrolling the previous content continues to stay on the screen, not allowing me to see anything. Hopefully this bug gets fixed soon;

"Surprisingly really nice. Not going to lie. But the image and video quality is so bad. Like the compression is so so so terrible. If that was changed and we could have better video and image quality it would be so much better <33 please add that lol otherwise its actually really nice. Also having a ""following only"" browse feature would be so cool too üëçüëç new feature req. Being able to switch between mult accs!!";
Trying out the app. It's very new at this time, so who knows. So far it seems alright, there's content, a lot of big names are already using it. I've never used Twitter, so I don't know how it compares. I will state here, I've heard rumors that Threads will be actively censoring nazi content, and I'm here for that. Looking forward to nazi-free social media experience;

Useless app;
If you enjoy censorship and data collection this is your platform;
Fantastic It's good better than Twitter;
üëç;
No option for new usernames;
I don't find my following and followers list. And;
No option to only see posts from people you follow on the home feed or view posts chronologically, just the same firehose of jumbled algorithm garbage that infests IG.;
I wish i could but i logged off Instagram by accident a while back and cant remember my log in. I asked them for help and they shut me out. Glad. Good riddance;
A good start as an alternative to twitter but with a long way to go. Why on earth is it not available on PC?;
amazing for everyone they need to have it on computers too this app is very good :D for phones i reccomend it for everyone;
It has a lot of potential, I feel that its missing a few features such as a following/suggestions option on the FYP. an easier setup for being able to see and read replys, I find it difficult to see the replys for a specific post. Another feature I would recommend is a like count on the account page.;
It's Instagram not Twitter;
I don't have Instagram account;
A app with the Hardware of Twitter & The software of Instagram.;
Coolüëç;
The feed is very irrelevant.;
New experience. I think it will be better more;
Decent app with the most basic of microblogging functionality. Only big due to the brand name - had this been any startup, this would have been dead in the water. Lacks basic functionality such as a web interface and user sign-ups without having to tie an Instagram account. Block feature is also not working as you can still see the posts of a blocker user.;
app doesn't work properly, it keep crash;
"When I am trying to login then I am getting an error like"" An unexpected error occurred Account. Please try logging in again."" Almost from 5 days. Why?? I have already changed my password from Instagram and trying but haven't get any success response";
App Copied from Twitter;
Make sure meta will add more features.;
Hate social media but Hate mr musket more.. the more users of threads the more angry the retard gets.. let us all join and make the Auti cry like a girl :D;
Nice;
üôå;
Op;
I downloaded it 5-6 hours after release and it was crashing and a lot of glitches were there;
This app is so good. I just hope that it has edit and pin to top options too;
The app works well and is great but it needs to open up it's policies for use of certain language as well as certain content (with of course content moderation).;
Banned on my first post. Back to Twitter.;
Run great and im glad that there's a Twitter alternative. But, it works more like an instagram extension then another app. It might as well be implemented within it rather then make me jump back.;
This is a winderfull appp;
Guuu;
App is jaka naka...Hm As Rafi;
Fan-freaking-tastic!;
No hay porno, ni libertad de expresi√≥n;
Shows posts from random popular pages I'm not interested in instead of posts for the pages I follow!! Please fix this asap!!;
Nice app;
Worst app;
Checking....;
You have to have intergarm to sign up;
Best;
Overall better than Twitter It's missing a couple of minor features that make Twitter a little bit better like your header but past that it's basically the same but better because elon's ruined the Twitter platform. Apparently there's some bugs that you should be aware of if you go installing this. I haven't experienced one.;
üëç;
It's alright its pretty much Twitter, I imagine it'll be a less political place;
Na, too like Twitter but owned by Meta. I'll take Twitter 2.0 over Threads any day. No censorship which is all Meta/Facebook does...;
Decent, but drains battery and just has less features than Twitter;
Tried and did not like at all. Back to Twitter.;
Buggy, no interaction, couldn't uninstall without uninstalling Instagram. Pretty shallow interaction. Pass.;
Lmao eat my home made vanilla and chocolate, Zuck.;
Crashes everytime i try to post;
Outstanding;
Why don't you give us an option where we can see the posts of people only we follow and not n number of random meaningless stuff in which we are not interested at all?;
I highly recommend this Threads an instagram app the content please follow, share, and support this appüòç‚úîÔ∏è Please ‡¶°‡¶æ‡¶ì‡¶®‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶æ‡¶° this appüòäüòä Thank you.;
Nice üëç hai super;
Useless;
Thank you so much;
amazing app;
Woke;
Once I open the app shows overlapped content consistently Giving us a dizziness and irritation. 2. Unable to download the media like photos making it very difficult to use this if we want the media.;
Good experience;
"Good Start, but intermittent bugs. Today, as I was following people back, it would periodically start flashing this box that said, ""Something went wrong, try again,"" that box would vanish & then reappear like a strobe with no way to exit, other than force stopping the app. Then, once restarted, all the people I'd just followed would just show as new requests, even though I'd just followed them? Frustrating! These glitches all started since the update yesterday";
Ladkiya pot jayenge na;
It works, but the home feed is nothing but strangers talking about stuff I don't care about. I would prefer to just see posts from the people I follow. That's why I follow them. I like the lack of a trending tab, but I see no point in using this app until the home tab is cleaned up and we get a followers view.;
Copycat;
Copycat;
No volume, everything keeps glitching, Twitter is better.;
Don't like the scrolling. It still lacks features. User can't explore communities easily yet.;
One of my main reasons for liking Twitter was to follow great journalists and hear and share breaking news, but since Threads has banned Canadian news I don't see a reason to bother trying it out.;
Thanks and nice aaps;
Nice app;
Twitter is better;
Ye threads Jo hai ye ekdam Twitter ka copy h üòè;
Highly censored. Pass;
It's promising but please keep my feed stuff I follow. That is my biggest issue with that other app.;
It looks like Twitter but I don't understand why you have to have an Instagram account to be able to use what is supposed to be related to Twitter.;
It's so boring, pretty much it is just a comments section out of instagram. And deleting threads account will delete instagram, and on top it collects and track all user details.;
Worst app. Never download. Copy of twitter. Fake things. Now I can't even delete it.;
Best app;
Nice app to connect with world;
It's awesome and Twitter has been unmarked, it's fun to do thatüòò;

Show me the updates from the people that I FOLLOW. Why pushing random accounts to the feed? I haven't come across a single friend's account in the last two days.;

Amazing Ads free experience and pure content at full scale. This is what we need. There should be different types of tick for verification of users. Private user, Normal user, content creator and Pro User.;

I hate that you keep showing all accounts I don't follow and less of the accounts I follow. It felt like this is a subtle way to advertise accounts instead of running ads. Both annoying.;
it's a really good app,i sometimes don't receive any notifications on it unless i open it then notifications come in but it's good nothing to complain about so far.;
Very good;
This app is now good...use it;
bad app;
The app is completely compatible with my device, does not crash unlike what other users experienced apparently. Also, it's better than twitter. It's a yes from me.;

Total bs app. No concern for privacy ,just another attempt by meta to get our data. Would prefer Twitter anyday over it, it's just a leftist attempt to destroy twitter;
Nice;
UPDATE: App works perfectly fine since the update. ORIGINAL REVIEW: The app runs fine, but I can't check out my account's Following list, as well as other accounts Following lists either to follow accounts I recognize from other platforms (the same Following list error/glitch has been happening on Instagram, too). Hopefully this error/glitch will be addressed soon in a future app update.;

Threads nice application;
A friend was banned for health advice..;
I'll stay with Twiter!;
It's an absolute copy of Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg needs to bring something new, always copying an already existing application and releasing as your own. Develop something new which you can say with pride that it is what is made by myself. Copying Twitter won't help.;
My thread is full of stuff I have zero interest in. I have to scroll down and mute tons of rubbish before I get to anything I follow;
HORRIBLE buggy bad wannabe twitter. Drains battery bug. Heats up all devices. Interferes with wifi and mobile network settings. Ignores permission denials. Breaks privacy apps settings. This should be banned and illegal. Horrible. Google play should be ashamed.;
Twitter is good;
I want the threads I'd on ny Instragram bio How can I add that;
Great design and awesome features but sometimes app isn't working prorperly and showing insta followers on threads and somehow disappearing threads posts. Need little bit fixing.;
Copy Paste of Twitter;

App is fine. Beats the monstrosity that Twitter has become under Elongated Musk.;
This is very amazing app üòçü§© üòçü§©;

You have to delete your insta account to get rid of it. Dumbest thing I've ever heard of. I don't use Twitter and I don't want to use this.;
So much better than Twitter. Ever since Elon Musk took over, he's been ruining that platform. Threads feels like a breath of fresh air in comparison.;

It lacks some of the important features and timeline is such a mess.;

Same people different app. We are at the saturation stage that all people are doing is transfering everything we have seen to yet another platform. Influencers are desperate to be the first big thing. Same people, another home.;
Good app thank you #mark;
Accha app hai;
Facebook ü§¨;
Very buggy, initially after getting it, it took over 60 hours before any content showed whatsoever on my feed, despite me following many people and my partner having loads on her feed. Recently, it took me about 48 hours to upload something on it while Instagram and other apps worked perfectly fine. Multiple attempts occurred both on wifi and on mobile data with no results. It'd be really cool if the bugs could get sprayed down some more, maybe get Daxter on it.;
üòòüòòüòò;
Really don't like how its feed is filled with people I don't follow üòÖ;
theres a text limit up to 50 characters only, i cant write freely because of that, sue it;

Well it's kinda good, but I prefer Twitter more;
It is a bad app;
"Meh. I really wanted a good alternative to Twitter but this isn't it. The UI is pretty basic looking and there's just no settings. It starts showing loads of threads from people you aren't following and you can't stop it. It's basically always stuck on the ""for you"" section on Twitter.";

Everything that was wrong and extremely wrong with Twitter pre 2023 this verbatim twitter clone is, from the fake trendings, to the horrible recommendations in your feed, and the permanent synchronization to your Instagram. This platform from Meta seeks to bring back thought police and cancel culture through the Google Plus-YouTube method of signups. All the above plus Zuck selling your data.;

Osm bhai;
I find it quite annoying that you cant log in with your Google ID and have to instead log in/create an account with Instagram! Also changing your username or name in general... you have to do it via Instagram. I would love to try the App out, but considering that I always have separate accounts accross different Social Medias, I have to wait, until Meta decides to review this issue, in which Im apparently not the only one.;

Not Great I really can't believe in order to change my profile picture as a verified user I have to do it via Instagram and even when I do it from there it does not change. It is said that I need to subscribe and give ID in order for me to have a display picture. Kind dumb and unfair;
What is the point of this app? I have tried it but its just a separated Instagram comment section. Maybe they're going after non Instagram users because why would you use this if you are already on Instagram? I just thought they would've done something more adventurous.;
Nice app;
No respect for data privacy. Usual META behaviour.;

This app is a copy of Tweeter, actually tweeter is better than Threads and Koo is better than tweeter.;

Another way for meta to track you. That's it. They saw a gap forming in the industry and decided to take more for themselves. Meta very nearly has a monopoly on social media and is known to nab everything from your device they can just to sell for profit to unknown parties.;

Somehow, my threads app works now. Wow. Check my edit history to see screenshot of how it was. Now, using the app, it seems to be solid. Feels like instagram with a different skin on it. I dont dislike so far. Will continue to use and will update my review in a bit.;
The scroll is not that smooth. I have to work harder to scroll.;

Love the app, but it crashes randomly when I try to post comments. Anyone got any ideas on how to fix this?;
0 privacy;
This app sucks. It's key problem is that it CANNOT BE REMOVED WITHOUT DELETING INSTAGRAM. Do not download this app. I don't see many people using it either. It asks for many permissions when creating an account with no warning that you cannot remove the threads link from your profile or delete your account. It's a data miner with no benefits.;
Nice;
"It was great for like three days until my feed became 99% accounts I don't follow or care to see. Like another reviewer said, it's mostly blue check accounts (celebrities or Instagram ""models"") that I don't want to see instead of accounts I actually follow. Mix in a ton of spammy ""grow your threads"" posts from bots and that's the current experience. I think I spent most of my time on the app the last two days muting and blocking accounts but at this point I give up.";

This is what Twitter wanted to be until they changed their management and ruined it by letting rampant hate. Longer posts, simple engagement, just better Twitter. It just needs to continue to add things like video, gifs and such. Happy with it. Happy to have SWITCHED to it.;

Good app so far I have used it for 10 hours it's amazing a few things to be included in future update like messaging, tagging in photos.;
Great app;
very bad imitation of Twitter;
Another phenomenal socmed platform by Meta! I just downloaded this yesterday and I am already comfortable with using it. The user interface is super easy to learn and get used to. Plus, the features are superb. You can literally upload Threads in one click. Furthermore, you can also reply to other people's post with text, image, and other interactions. They're all visible in one place, unlike to the other confusing and dizzying platform called Twitter. <3 LOL;
Better than Twitter;
I wrote down words and tried to correct for wrong spelling or error in words. After I pressed delete or backwards button, I could no longer write any more words. I had to discard the current thread and tried to write a new thread. In the new one, the error was gone until I pressed delete text button. FYI, It happened in Andriod mobile app when I first wanted to post a new thread. I want you to fix this bug very soon.;
Something wrong. Not working properly;

Has a lot of potential, but your newsfeed is literally ONLY people you don't follow. It's all just really cringe memes and 2012 tumblr-eqsue jokes.

"Not only is it an incomplete, glitchy app. It broke my Instagram app. After deleting my threads account and uninstalling. My Instagram still has the threads badge on my bio. No matter how many times I press ""remove badge"" to temporarily remove it, the moment I refresh my insta page the badge is back on my bio. Meta is using my bio to advertise this app. I have expressed I hate it by uninstalling it and deleting my account it's disingenuous. Shouldn't my data be deleted? Why is there a badge";
great app and it‚Äôs pretty decent. however, it would be great if we got to change our usernames and names that is not in lined with instagram.;
The posts in here are the most mundane, vapid junk I've ever seen. It seriously feels as if AI is making all the posts. On top of that there's no way to refresh the main (and only!!) Feed with new content. You are stuck with the same feed throughout the day, which only incrementally gets new content added to it as the day goes on.;
This application will provide the information on the program;
The app is great and I like I can connect to my favourite celebrity's. However since I downloading and installing threads my instagram has been hack into 4 times which I had to reset my password. Would love to keep but for my security reasons I'm having to delete the app. Sucks too because I loved it.;
I love you insta;
I barely opened the account and I already started receiving spam messages. It is so plain. You can't customize it. It doesn't even show much besides the things that you are not interested in. This app sucks.;

Great start for a positive space. Like many reviews so far there are things to add to the app to make it better. The search page is a bit bland maybe more like insta? A visual thing. Trending would be good on there too. And instead of the usual drab news stories why not the best most positive news stories circulating. The no ads is a winner for me though that will probably change. I have to say it is a breath of fresh air so far. But it needs to stay a positive place.;

This app requires near criminal levels of data collection and oppressive permissions to your devices. If you value your privacy at all, delete it immediately.;
Too much bugs. Please fix some bugs first. For example, when I click the delete button for fixing the word/line, all the other words will mix/collide and create some never ever known word.;
They are collecting all of your data, and recording through your cameras then selling it to the highest bidder;
I'm one that I didn't hate or love Twitter. But I thought I would try this out like the other social apps recently. And Threads has it right it's easy to use and I like that you can just use all of you just snyc all of your IG followers. They have that info anyway. The only thing is there's not very much socializing Yet.;

"A welcome option to get away from Twitter, but migration, though painless, comes without a few much needed aspects. Searching by keywords for posts about a subject can't be done. No option to see trending subjects either. And the app does not always keep its last position, resulting sometimes in restarting from the very beginning of your feed. The recent update fixed the jerky scrolling; everything else is pending more updates!";

Only want to see people I follow and not everyone else's feed. That's part of the reason I don't like Instagram as much as I use to. I don't like being forced to have other people's post show up on my feed when I'm trying to see what my friends and family are up to.;
Better than TWITTER;
Not bad but still needs a ton of improvement. For example fixing the timeline.;
The feed algorithm is hell on earth. No features. Pointless and will die in a few months. Was really hoping it would be good and save us from Elon;
It takes a lot of effort to open it;
Needs some polishing up but already nicer than Twitter.;
Copy;
Fix the gifs. Its coming out green and purple!;
Good;

invasion of privacy;
Agree with you;
Twitter for tankies;
Most Useless app;
I can't login to threads . Horrible experience;
Installed threads then found myself banned from commenting for one week. No help from meta even when reporting a problem. Stick to twitter folks. The REAL freedom. ‚úåÔ∏èüëå;
It needs a lot of work. It constantly crashes, to the point where I can barely use it. It isn't auto-following everyone I follow on insta. I can't search for terms, which lead me to a topic I'm interested in and the layout feels quite lacking. It needs some sort of visual flare: animations, pops of colour, page transitions, etc... just something to make it all feel pleasing and tie it into a great package.;
Needs a TON of work, but I will hold out hope. There is no real search. No GIF keyboard. Some glaring bugs. Definitely released early, but with that in mind, it is quite smooth for what it does.;
Copied...;
Still got more work to do to beat Twitter;
So why can't I see the number of people that I am following? Why am I being shown all of these pages that I do not follow?;
Why zuck;
Amazing apps for me;
I tried to make an Instagram account of my normal email, nothing unusual and my account was banned before I could even log on. Now it wants my phone number and a selfie. I think I'll just use a different app that doesn't require such sensitive info just to try it out. Thanks but no thanks.;
PLEASE add hashtags, I hate getting stuff unrelated on my feed, I need hashtags to follow accounts with similar tastes as me.;
Nice app;
Beautiful;
Random feed sucks. It makes the experience awful and the social app loses its purpose. Terrible experience.;
Bad;
Will not recommend. Its just a cheap version of Twitter.;
The simple fact that it sabotages that egomaniac elon is a plus. 5 stars from me;
Good app;
Nice app;
I'm having a hard time certain threads videos on the app. No volume as soon as I push the little speaker it freezes.;
Pretty Solid App. Wish it didn't show me threads from people I don't follow, and an easier way to find people and subjects through searching. Very fun and simple to use. Surprisingly well managed and appropriate.;
At first, I used this app, everything was okay. But, yesterday, when I wanted to open my account, it said that someone had logged out my account and said that maybe the owner had changed the password. I never logged out and changed the password. Hope you have a solution to this issue. I don't want to lose my Instagram account because of this.;
Censored free speach app;
Twitter üòé;
Being forced to have an instagram account;
I installed it because I don't like musk that much lol;
I don't like it, less features, please update;
Awful i would never support the zuck this is trying to beat elon and we all know zuck is in the govts back pocket and elon is on the peoples side so if your for the constitution dont use this app!!;
All the best;
Twitter Wannabe. Please, at least provide something different. This is just a cheap copy of Twitter. Elon does it better. It's too funny that Meta is actually just copy pasting Twitter. Cheap copy. Weak. Useless. Nothing new. Where are the new innovative ideas. Boring and childish behaviour from a huge company just copy pasting another companies ideas. Laughable 3 thumbs down üëé;
Most of my feed is people I'm not even following...;
LOVELY;
"Ik this app just started but theres some basic functions that are missing. for example ""add account"" for people like me who has 2 accounts. I hate logging out and logging in and my personal has 2 fact on so i always have to wait for auth on my ig app to log in.";
Your aap sad is;
"Not a fan that the only sign-up option is to use an Instagram account, instead of letting you choose to a Meta account. Funny considering it says very clearly at the bottom ""from Meta"".";

Just joined it but looks like nice and smoothly working AAP but still lot to done on this AAP.;
Sameer;
Nice app;
Another half baked app. Why do companies keep doing this? The clowns that made PokemonGo did it first and here we are again. You can't fix a bad first impression and y'all are mad goofy for releasing this pile of rubbish. Twitter is bad, but this is just pathetic. I've seen high schoolers put in more effort. Downloaded and deleted.;
Dont download if you will delete threads app it will delete your all instagram data ypur ig profile will be dismissed;

One of the wrost software, I have ever been used. After installing and use my Instagram profile & Facebook profile was hacked and compromised. Generally I requested all of you don't use this application. One more thing if you install it you can't withdraw from your Instagram account. One of the failure application of Meta.;
Nice;
I would give this zero stars if that was possible. It's like Twitter from wish and threads doesn't allow free speech and is heavily censored. Shame on meta for even coming up with the idea to copy Twitter.;

First man 5‚≠êstart #nicethreads;
For the devs, here are pointers on how you can improve the app: 1. Allow users to save pictures. 2. Only censor porn on profiles below 18. 3. Have a translation feature. 4. Do not repeat the same mistake as Twitter where accounts that the users aren't following are appearing on their feed. If y'all just wanna make a Twitter ripoff, at least make it a better version from the very start.;
It's good, but i prefer and would use Twitter anyday, honestly.;
So much spam. I go to a popular post and 70% of the replies are people saying to do 'x' for $5,000 or proving links. It's a ton of spam and bots at the moment. Makes me sadly go back to Twitter for now.;
Need more work.;
Very confusing user interface. Looks like the cheap copy of Twitter.;
Very useful;
Good;

Basically Twitter with censorship.;
It's disorganized and u can't even see posts from who u follow on ur feed. Also theirs no way to filter content on ur feed. The mute and block r ok buts it needs more filter options.if I could I'd give it 0 stars;
Excellent so far! Really enjoying it. Looking forward to upcoming updates and meaningful conversations!;

I like the threads app for meta, but I am concerned it could share the wrong data.

This way I and anyone else with a Instagram account can be comfortable using it alone side Instagram for fashion, photography, and gaming? I want to give it a try, but that social media site made me uncertain if I should use it. Thank You.;

"The cookie is still in the oven, but you're impatient and want it now. Cons: Videos not playing after unmuting. No hashtags. Feed is too random and crowded. Needs a following tab.

Let alone some button clicking! Maybe the issue is only applicable for a few type of users. But, please fix the bug. In spite of this app's being great, I have to stay neutral by giving 2 stars is just because of these bugs.;

Its fine. Does it function? Yes. Is it a good social media platform? Absolutely not. The only people who ever pop up on the home page are people you followed from instagram or meme pages you have 0 interest in that only ever post about threads. Theres no algorithm to help you find new accounts you might like. If you're a small creator you'll get 1 like from someone who follows you on instagram and then your post gets buries. Dont bother;

Upgraded to 5 star cause meta team heard my complaint as soon as I reported it. the bug I've experienced earlier before the update was fixed already and I can use the app now normally no matter what the theme is. however, it looks like the update was only intend to fix the bug issue + performance improvement and nothing more. anyway, the app looks nicer now and smooth after the update but, surprised to see how rapid the ratings of the app recede in a couple of days after the launch.;

Can you update translation features into this threads.because it will be more useful for the users.;
Nyc;
Super;
Terrible app;
How to search threads by people in search option...???;
Meta is still Facebook, threads will forever be unhealthy, and leave you seeking negative attention. Fk the zuck.;
Does exactly what it's supposed to, not for me though;
Doesn't work anymore;
Supar;
Way better than Twitter;
It is good but some more improvements can be made. If you give some new updates then it will be more fun to use. Us and this is a great app. If you give the feature of chatting in this too, then there will be a little more fun in chatting.;
yo threads is way more better than twitter #zuku brother is the best #mark zukerburgez;
Can't use unless you have Instagram account,;
It is not working in Russia üá∑üá∫;

The app is overall good. But we can't make two accounts. Means on insta we can login two accounts. But on threads, I can't login another account.;
It's pretty cool . One of the best social media apps;

Very bad copy of twitter.;
Poorly done app, and once you realize it's bad, you can't even delete it without deleting your whole instagram account. Strongly recommend to not get this app;

Not useful if you want to delete threads account you have to delete your Instagram account too üëé;

UX can improve. Scrolling isn't smooth and lags. The flood of followers gained by the follow all option is not the best.;
Good;
Major features are missing - 1. No hashtags 2. Search only brings back accounts to follow...it should show relevant posts. 3. No trending;

cheating;
Wasn't it right that threads would have been a separate platform, I mean login from Instagram because there are many flaws like you can edit account in threads, privacy, change username and many things that change Instagram We want threads to be a separate platform. If I want to link, that is a different matter;
I accidentally linked my account to it but sadly i can't delete my threads account without deleting my instagram account. Such a trashh app;

Can't upload videos with photos lately!!! Buggy!!!!;
I don't know how this work;
Lacks a lot of features so here's some feedback: Add a trending page in there. Make it so that the followers and following can be accessed separately, like on IG. Allow people to have different usernames from their IG handles. When there's a bunch of images, show them in a collage instead of showing one big image and then scrolling to the others like in IG. Also, let people zoom into pics without the images resizing themselves automatically. Don't compress images. Make it different from IG.;
Worst app if I delete it due to some reasons it will delete my original account on Instagram üì∑;
Useless;
Why should I delete insta account to delete threads;
Love it ü§ç;
Bad;
Uninstalled the same day as installing it. This is just another addition to the ultra-intrusive suite of applications from Meta. There's no way this garbage is even touching the feathers of Twitter.;
Good;
Cool;
I dunno what happened but can you bring back my account?? like fr my threads suddenly got disabled and now even my Instagram account was disabled.. seriously I shouldn't have downloaded this app if I know what's gonna happen;
MaZaa to Aa rHa hai halka halka.ü§ü;
I realize the app is in its infancy, but this thing is really inconvenient. I can only use the app from my phone to post. I can't use it on my laptop at all, not even taking something from my Instagram page and crossposting. Please fix this. Allow us to post from devices other than just phones. I have failing eyesight and this becomes a real problem for me because my phone screen (and anything I write using it) is so small.;
Good;
Really this is a good app ü§© We always get good facilities from Twitter üôÇ;

A very bad application first, because I hate a person called Mark, secondly, because he is a literal imitation of Twitter;
Twitter > Threads;
Wasn't able to open the app after download;
Very good üëçüèª;
Very similar to Instagram and Facebook can't beat twitter I think who will download the app is the same of people who have Instagram and Facebook only;
Pathetic and the most confusing app.;
Better than the blue bird;

It's applications are very poor it's looking like üê¶ twitter not a new platform;
annasir24;
NOT open social network as claimed. Even when it finally implements ActivityPub, still not 'open'. It's a scam.;
U shud add some interesting features in this app which no other app have....jus like liking pic showers hearts n some other kind of interesting stuff....;
Nice;
Good;
I don't like mark mama;
Too slow to use;
What's the point of having the offensive filter on when the filters can't even block posts that contain obviously misogynistic language?;
Nic threads;
Vary good threads apps..;
I don't want to have an Instagram account in order to use this.;
The app has been good so far, just a little inconvenience today, I couldn't upload a photo and I couldn't see my followers, kindly look into that, awesome job so far.;
Having trouble setting up/managing multiple profiles.;
Lolu app;
The app is great but it's also fun*king annoying one minute I can follow someone the other minute I can't Sometime I can't even post really had a rough time with it but I love the app that's why I'm giving it 5 star please fix the issues And another thing it keeps blocking me out of the app some times saying we restrict so so nd so something like that pls fix the app;
Zucks sucks;

Just Bad;
Love it but I can't even reply or post atm pls fix the bugs so I can thread;
Good;
The idea of the app is fun. It feels like a safe space where people are sharing thoughts and ideas. There are a few bugs, sit crashes often and it has slowed down IG as well. But it's a new app. I'm not expecting perfection yet since it was only launched a week ago.;
twitter tryna be;
Nice one;
I use it in my sister phone cuz she have insta but the bad thing u neet to create an insta account and after u come to threads for that i think i not gonna use it and i think if u can create a new account in this app it will be good and it be better than Twitter btw i still using Twitter;
Can't search for users Have to scroll all the way up to refresh, no pull down to refresh. Have to click multiple times to see reply to a reply. Didn't get get any activity from followers on my post. Unclear if they are inactive or not seeing my posts.;

Unlike this app, Twitter is for the free: Free speech. No government censorship. Less data collected. Contribute your voice to humanity‚Äôs digital public square! The best way to fight misinformation is to respond with accurate information, not censorship.;
Its a great app;
I like the simplicity and the focus on conversation. Plus, no ads yet, which is why I gets 5 stars. There's no clear organization of threads. I like the panorama photo presentation, too, it's slick. Threads can't take credit for the quality of users, but I'm rather enjoying the pleasant and kind people I see on there.;
Steal all your personal data as usual from meta nothing new;
it was great! lovin' d app so far üíò pero I hope it have like the thing to pin ur post;
Good üëç;
Pure copy cat with subtraction of (freedom of speech) remove sensorship then we can consider;
must be include dark mode;
Signed up, seeing nothing but utter rubbish, people who like the sound of their own voices.;
Downloaded on day one and have througoly enjoyed this app since. People actually interact with each other and far right trolls don't even last a day. Oh, and I haven't seen a single ad!;
New issue, people are replying to me but I haven't seen any of their reply notifications for NINE hours! I've cleared cache, logged out and back in, uninstalled and reinstalled, still not seeing notifications of replies.;
Nice app;
Couple of days after launching and nothing is working.;
nice and simple. although unlike twitter you can only see things posted by people you search for or follow;
Nothing special, just an imposter of Twitter;
Useless app;

It has a lot of problem with persian (farsi) language but except that one thing , it's incredibly good;

So far so great! Just deleted the bird after 14 years.;
Very nice application;
It doesn show the replies in posts. It shows something went wrong. The only screen that works is the wall, for all the others it shows something went wrong. How possible a giant company makes such a trash application;
so nice app;
ŸÉŸä ŸÜŸÖŸä;
Rey2Eer44Tttt;
Only log in thru Insta. Should have been other options too. Downloaded and then deleted as no other log in options available. What if people not having Insta, wanna onboard threads for a different experience;
You can't create a new account. You have to use an already existing instagram account. Also, there is no website on PC. Useless.;
"Kye ghatiya app hai üò° Ek bhi ladki reply nahi karti "" DoN'T INSTALL THIS APP""";
Pretty much a copy of Twitter except you'll get censored if you speak out about certain topics so no free speech!;

"Its just not working. It was fine for a while but something happened and now whenever I try to check my notifications or write something, it says ""sorry something went wrong"". Tried reinstalling, didn't help, it's simply just broken. I was already disappointed in this half-baked trash that lacks even the most basic functions like hashtags, but at my current state, I'm unable to do anything but refresh the timeline which is filled with unfunny meme accounts and verified scum. Unusable. Zuck lost.";

Publicity highly misleading. Should be a stand-alone app but instead it's only available tied to your Instagram account. If it WERE stand-alone, I would most probably use it - the world needs an alternative to Twitter... AND to Instagram (even though they're both Meta). Uninstalled.;
Yea toh khul hi nahi Raha;
Sure, I'd be happy to review Instagram Threads for you. Threads is a standalone app from Instagram that was designed to be a more personal and private way to connect with your close friends. It's a great way to share your day-to-day moments with the people who matter most to you, without having to worry about your posts being seen by a wider audience. Some of the things I like about Threads include: It's a more personal and private way to connect. Threads is only visible to your close friend;
This is garbage üóë;

I haven't run into many issues, mostly because I'm not much of a poster so I'm not adding photos and everything else, BUT the past couple of days my feed is full of accounts I don't follow. Sometimes it's because someone I follow commented or rethreaded it, but that's not usually the case anymore. I use the app to keep up with and engage with the people I actually follow, not everyone else;

I love how simplistic it is. I also really like that you can't DM, so I feel like I won't get harassed by bots. It's way more simplistic compared to Twitter, but I prefer it this way. - Update 7/15/2023 I lower my review to 3 starts because the app stopped working properly. It won't load posts on anyone's profile including mine anymore. My activity feed will not load. And I can't load replies on posts. It's really disappointing.;

The Scrolling is not smooth like other Meta Apps. I have to push the content up hard. Please fix this.;
Basically like Twitter bunded with your insta account and if you wanna logout on threads you basically have to logout from your insta Id;
It will be interesting if it is also compatible with Mastodon. Then it will really be better than Twitter.;

This app is NOT good at all. Do not waste your time trying to make it work. The algorithm is the worst recommending stuffs that are completely different from your insta account. It seems like people are just tryif to use the app, but there is nothing really interesting A complete waste of time. I'll stay in Twitter btw;
Jha2 app;
It's not bad but it has some way to go before it can compete with Twitter. For me personally the app is just too basic and lacks features. Also, not a fan of not being able to register via email rather than through instagram. Obviously it's still early days but I'll be uninstalling for now.;
So good;

Waste app;
Twitter copy, the app isn't even good, no dms , no hashtags, no trending topics tab. It is made just to promote cancel culture.;

Really glitchy at the moment. Can't reply to others'threads or replies in my threads. Eveytime I type replies the app closes completely. Can only write new threads so basically just talking to myseld with no way of interacting with anyone at the moment.;
It's a worst app and waste of time,net ,;
I have been face some problem. When I will be a post every times it's will be failed. So you should solve this problem as soon as possible.;

First installed on my iPhone. Worked OK for a few days but then stopped showing notifications (just keeps saying try again). Refreshing doesn't help. Reinstalling doesn't help. Can't see comments on other posts. Tried the Android version and got exactly the same experience. Needs fixing;

This is very very frustrating!!!!! 3 stars because of this issue could be 5 if someone from support could help me out.** 5 days now so I'm going to start dropping the stars.;
Since day one I am using this app ...

It's just too random with no control over who's post pops up on feed, kills the purpose of following/unfollowing folks. In a way, it's worse than seeing ads. It'd be usable if we could limit main feed posts to only the ones who we follow and then a separate explore/Activity section.;

This is also the reason why I stopped using this the last time, I got frustrated because it kept refreshing(?) or closing and the thread I was composing is not even saved.;

No privacy üëé.;
I keep getting thread unable to load notifications today and banned from following people a lot. Not all of us had an instagram instafollowing. Many of us from twitter had large accounts and have come to this basic, phone only site, and are liking the atmosphere and baring with the lack of functionality we are used, such as, hashtags and content search engines. We mostly wish they would at least lift what is causing these following bans so we could all get reconnected here on Threads. üíô;
Better than Twitter but still run by another fool.;
no privacy. meta want to know about you everything. be careful;
Stiff 1:1 scrolling makes this essentially unusable as a modern social media app. Just use regular Android scrolling.;

It's a far worse version of Twitter. Only one feed filled with random accounts I have 0 interest in following. There's no hashtags, no related accounts pop up when you follow someone. Account is attached to Instagram, so you'd have to delete your insta account to delete your threads one and there's trending tab of course. It's not horrible but feels very rushed, random and insular.;
Nice App;
Yes they copied twitter but i feel I'm being monitored closely. Reading their privacy policy after i opened an account, i found out all my data is being used and sold. Also i can't delete my account without it affecting my Instagram.(An account deleted on Thread also delete their Instagram account). I would advice you don't download this app because you need an instagram profile to do so. Soo sad.;

This is clearly a very early and poorly tested version of the app that was pushed out to cash in at the right time. First, the app crashes a LOT. Simply opening certain people's threads closes the app every time, but works perfectly on other threads. This is pretty much a deal breaker. Second, I think it's fair to say a web version or desktop app should have been available from the beginning. The fact that it's missing just means it's all a side effect of rushing out this new platform. AJ 505;

Nice app;
The app is going well and nice, easy to use, and friendly. But I recommend a delete, edit,and save option. A Delete option to be able to clean the activity or notification. To be able to edit a message or picture to add a caption when it's already posted, and a save and bookmark option. I personally need the delete option, I can't help but get anxiety when my activity is messy. I tried checking a post notification of an activist, but it swarmed up my activity history. Please add options.;

Threads, an Instagram app is a big no-no for me. The app is glitchy, slow, and boring. It's like a bad version of Twitter that nobody asked for. Why would I want to use another app to share text updates and join public conversations when I can already do that on Instagram or Twitter? The app also makes me nervous about my privacy and security, as it may share my data with third parties without telling me. Threads, an Instagram app is not worth my time or my phone's memory.;
Not interesting like Facebook or Instagram;
This is very vender full application;
The App keeps closing when I tried write more than one sentence and tag my friends.;

This app is boring, what's the point of having this? You have 1000s of followers and get 5 likes. What a waste of time this app is. Worst part is all you see are verified people complaining about irrelevant things in their perfect lives.;

Definately a better option than Twitter some might say it a straight copy I agree but its way more better in experience, decluttered, more transparent, one thing I feel that should improve on is to make the so app or account a seperate entity.;
Why doesn't it have a dark mode??? Needs a dark mode.;

It was working perfectly until a few days ago and now I can't see anything in my activity tab, I can't post any new threads, I can't reply to any threads, I can only see the first post in a thread but none of the replies. I can still like threads and follow people and that's it. It's pretty much useless to have a social media app if I can't interact with any of my friends and followers. So disappointed. I really thought I had found a viable replacement for that trainwreck of a blue bird app.;

Full of bots or people who apparently don't know how to say more than 1-2 words. There is absolutely 0 conversation happening and there is no way to see who I'm following. This was a completely half baked app that I'm almost sure it was forcefully published in the midst of Twitter having a crisis so they could try and gain some ground on Twitter. At the end of the day, both apps are terrible.;

Just a china copy of twitter. Mark should create something of his own rather than copying stuff from others.

Unbelievable this app, even after 2 years of development, decided to launch w/o hashtags, a following-only feed, translation for posts and other basic features that are standard with social apps. If you want a Twitter alternative that serves you better, Mastodon is by far the only one.;

Cool üòé to use thrrads. A good app. But in my point of view it should have to be updated like: Bring the post button at the top. Bring dark theme. Likes inactivity is good but bad than Twitter. Option of using hashtags and at last plz bring direct message.;

Recently joined this app. App is still in the development stages and many things are missing. However. I absolutely loved the competing app before new owner tore it apart. I think Meta owner and his Executive have potential to tear ceiling off that and may have learned something from competing owner's recent failed experiences. I have much hope for Threads!;
Cannot post & view the stuff that I have already posted;

The app doesn't work properly, it's full of bugs and errors, Even after deleting and reinstalling for a few times, it didn't get fixed.;

National Post article says. Threads collects so much sensitive information it‚Äôs a 'hacker‚Äôs dream,' experts say Meta captures everything from the information you give it when you sign up for accounts, to what you click on or like, who you befriend online and what kind of phone, computer or tablet you use to access its products;

I think it'll be better if another update for threadsapp would enable you share a video posted on threads to Instagram story while it's playing and not a static pic of the video as it is now;
This is great app;

This app died after one week of it's launch lol poor mans twitter that's what this app is.;

This app has i have lots off bags;
add hashtags already;
It's pretty bare as an app, but that also means you can only add-on features at this point, which is exciting. There's needs to be an easier way to go from Instagram to Threads. Having two apps is a bit much. It would be cool if they could both live in the same space;

I don't know what to say but I need to say something THIS APP IS AWESOME it have insta ui and twitter mixed I like this app;
Well, I'd love to use it but it won't let me post, I keep getting the 'Your thread failed to upload' message for days now. I tried clearing cache, force stopping, uninstall/reinstall...doesn't work. I'm giving it 2 stars because Instagram import seems to work and I could see other people's threads.;
Need to add some more features;

It's a copy of twitter , the app is launched to compete twitter,as mark Zuckerberg is a part of matrix ,decides to cancel the people who open minds ,so there is no freedom of speech , Zuckerberg doesn't know about privacy and decides who to ban and who to not ,can't ban woke but bans who are against it with the point of you ,;

If I follow certain accounts there's a reason for that - I want to see what they post. I don't want to see other random accounts in my feed. I don't want your 'recommendations'. Not very usable; just like Instagram which is meh.

Whenever you want to post a new thread with a picture it crashes. Unsatisfactory.;

Forced close on launch. Had been great.. added 200 of the 300 twitter people I follow (mostly just EU accounts missing now). But desperately needs a keyword search to find anything other than what the people I follow said.;
I am not impressed. The app should have been separated from IG. Any restriction on one should never have to affect the other. Again, the whole idea of not having access to one's followers list at some point is annoying. Can we have a tab to mass-unfollow everyone who isn't following back. I need my time line to be filled with contents I choose to see from followers. It crashes a lot too.;

Just doesn't work.. I see posts but no replies instead it only says something went wrong.. And can't post anything only said post failed to upload. As it is now it's useless and I would hate going back to twitter.. I tried every suggested fix that can be found on the Web.. Nothing works..;

Right now. This app sucks. No hashtags, no way of searching keywords. The only thing you can search is usernames. Your feed is loaded with a bunch of stuff you don't want to see. The app has potential but they rushed the launch. I'll give them a couple weeks to add some more features but right now there is no benefit for general users.;

After using my account for a few days my account was blocked. I haven't even made a post, they just decided I wasn't me. I'm signed in through my Facebook account, which isn't locked.;
bad app yrrüò°;
Love it;
Great app and Design is so cool.;
Way to many bugs and lagging slow speed and feel like total ripoff.;
Nikhil;
mark wasn't able to buy twitter so he made his own and that's what this app is.;
Boring and time wasting app a lot of time and energy waste that's way i hate it a lot üëé;
Good üòä;
loven it!;
Nice app;
Good‚ò∫Ô∏è;
So nic app;
Ok But Will Be Good Future App;
Meh Twitter clone.;
Wow;
Bugs ,bugs, cannot login when you change instagram password;
You can't be the original;
Good app;
Draining the battery and the app is missing a lot of features. They force you to use Instagram account for using the app. If I want to delete the account for Threads then I have to delete my Instagram account too. Please read details of the app it may collect before U download because they collect too much sensitive informations like financial and health also others details. The app working poorly because it keeps crashing when trying to post or comment and login push notification keep lagging.;
Somebody put a blanket on Twitter logo Also if you can add tiktok in insta why can't you just add threads as a feature in insta Also not a possible growth of someone who don't use insta;
Nice app;
Felt like I'm in mix of twittah and inst, but only the worst things from these apps. Really tastes disgusting;
Good üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëå;
Once upon a time, this app had the swagger of a superstar, but now it's just begging for a standing ovation from the exit door. The hype train has derailed, leaving nothing but a ghost town of deserted users in its wake. If boredom had an official spokesperson, it would be this app. Time to bid adieu to the good ol' days and embrace the exciting world of appsüê¶that actually deliver on their promises!;
It's always better at first tries but later then gets boring. The interfsce is still not that smooth and the feed is messy. I always see random people on my feed even though I don't follow them.;
Launched wayy to early. Missing essential features, content is just Instagram without pictures. If it improves I might rate it higher but for now it's just too bare bones.;
Works well and it's so far a better than blue bird experience, but there's a lot of room for upgrades.... if they happen, I'll upgrade my rating;
I lovr thia app so much But there is something that i really want you to add to it I want yoi to add a place we can have conversation nov just seeing post and commenting. If its just a place we can have a private chat with ourselves and groups;
God created us. We came from Adam and Eve. They were given choice and decided to ignore God's warning. They disobeyed. They were removed from paradise and were fallen. We have the same nature as them when we are born as humans. Unless we are born again. The only way to be born again is to trust in what Jesus did on our behalf, facing God's wrath which we deserved to face even though He lived a sinless life, even to death. Forgiveness of sins is only found in Jesus's name.;
Waste of time;
So boring aap and have so many glitches;
Lizard boy;
Nice üëç threads aap;
Boring af;
As usual, no followers no use, no one using it in the feed, despite a seamless launch for once;
Crashes all the time so what is the point;
A Twitter rip off;
Good.;
Too bad that this app has nothing original to offer;
Poor experience.;
Would be 5 star if not for the constant crashes, amazing app otherwise!;
It is a good app that fulfilled more than the minimum requirement for a social app. Congrats to Meta;

Not sure what the point of Threads is. Full of people selling stuff, anime, or people talking about Threads.;
Trash app.;
Why I have to delete my Instagram account!!!!;
Helllo;
Copy;
Very basic. Doesn't always auto follow who in your instagram list, as stated. Needs things like save, edit and a discover page, like Instagram, if it is to move forward.;
Like Twitter it's just for large corporations to say dumb things. Doesn't seem like there are any real people on here;
bad af;
garbage;
Copy of twitter;
Bad;
so bad;
Bad functionality and lacking features. Can't choose who I want to see. Poor knockoff of twitter.;
Terrible, download Twitter instead;
Title: A Game-Changer for Social Engagement - Instagram Thread App Review Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è (5/5) Review: Instagram Thread has undoubtedly transformed the way we connect and engage with others on social media. As an avid Instagram user, I am thrilled to share my experience with this remarkable new app. Instagram Thread takes the concept of storytelling to a whole new level, allowing users to dive deeper into conversations and share their thoughts in a more meaningful and organized way.;
I have had to report a system failure three separate times and I haven't received any response. I have also noticed that comments on my threads have been reported but I'm not the one that has reported them. Either I've already been hacked (it's only been about a week) or there's a lot of glitches that need to be fixed but either way I'm really frustrated with the fact that nobody has gotten back to me or even attempted to fix my problem.;
Just loved it more than how I loved twitter;
ŸÖÿßÿØÿ±ÿ™ Ÿà ÿ≥⁄Ø ⁄Øÿß€å€åÿØ;
Waste of time. Totally useless;
Would give five if it didn't keep closing when I'm trying to type a post!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;
good;
Sucks;
Since most of the people have multiple accounts on instagram, I hope it will be possible to have multiple accounts in threads too.;
Exellentüíù;
Its Twitter from the trash;
Good;
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶;
Awesome, kind space;
Twitter best;
Pathetic;
Same as twitter. But can't delete account? Likely buffing numbers or users.;
Awful;
Copy cats;
Wannabe twitter with censorship.;
I don't think this can make some damages to twitter ü§î but I don't know what the future will be;
10/10 for the UI, it looks cool and clean. But the feed is just infested with suggested content. At least on twitter you can separate the suggested content from the content of entities that you actually choose to follow. Might have some interest in Threads if they implement this feature, but for now... Bai;
Currently, it's very challenging to use. It's in dark mode and I want to change it to brighten it up. But apparently I can only change it through Instagram? Why? Dark mode needs to be improved. It's tough on the eyes and the UI is visually unbearable. Twitter nearly perfected the UI. I think it's a decent start but I can't use it for more than a couple of seconds even if I wanted to.;
C√≥pia barata do Twitter que tem acesso a muitos dados de seus usu√°rios. A concorr√™ncia ainda √© melhor.;
Can't delete my account;
not Twitter bad but still really bad;
A blend of twitter & insta, but somehow worse than both of them ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Maybe they'll improve features ü§ûüèº;
Useless üòí;
Boring;
Lagy scrolling that ununderstandable, because it's not happening to anyone else;
Excellent;
Very laggy.;
I dont like it when it connects with my others account and now i can't delete it. Its so annoying . And dont put it on the Instagram bio . Who give you permission to not delete our Instagram acc ?.;
For me now this app before I updated it is working very well, since I update it not allowed me to Post either picture or note don't know what happened;
I enjoy the App;
it sucks;
just garbage;
Why should you be required to have an Instagram account?;
Sike;
Terrible;
Horrible search feature;
Collects unnecessary data, no free speech, looks bland, no unique features, way too basic.;
Soo baad;
I am giving it a two star because I appreciate what you'll are trying to give us,but I wished that there could be more functions available in it. Like a translation option it will help us because some of the thing in it are from a different language so to understand that we need a translation option. I look forward for more development in this application and wish that you won't ignore this review and look into the matter deeply.;
Almost identical to but even worse than Instagram if that's possible. Still can't comment pics. Who developes a social media app without pictures? A fkn lizard! That's who!;
I'm sorry Threads. The algorithm is too boring. You push too much local content. The forced contents couldn't be more different from my taste. Twitter algorithm didn't push me local content. Twitter lets me see exactly what I want. After 2 whole weeks, I guess it's time to just quit Threads. The algorithm isn't worth it if all it does is push celebrity accounts, when I was never interested with them in the first place.;
Eh is missing some things, but the bots in this app is too much.;
Sampah;
Boring. Had it for 3 days and deleted it. Waste of time and info for the advertising behemoth that meta.;
The newsfeed so random, i follow my friend, my friend follow some people then its on my timeline/newsfeed, like huh not even in my interest even not im following them, worse social app i ever downloaded.;
When I use this app I feel that I Using tweeter but the truth is it,s not twitter it,s thread ‚ù§Ô∏è;
Lol. Mark talking about privacy. Seriously? And people are using it? I mean everyone is thinking it's free so what is the problem? When your all data being displayed in dark web and one day you got a message about a unknown transaction, then you will understand.;
Last 30 days consistent upload post but not viral. This is a new app Vary big problem üòï;
Not satisfied üòî;
T&C Dalna Bhool Gaye kya Mark Bhai;
Allow users to dissociate their account from Threads. It's very cunning to only allow users to delete their threads account if they agree to delete their Instagram along.;
1.5 rounded up.;
stuck in loading;
Great copy/paste attempt by Mark/Meta but fortunately didn't succeed against Twitter.;
Do NOT install! The app is following accounts automatically on behalf of my account or sending follow request without me knowing. I don't even open the up, just receiving the notifications. Isn't that illegal Zuck??;
Delete Delete Delete;
It won't let you delete your account without deleting your instagram!;
Copycat from twitter why do I rate 5 hahahh;
Because I can't let Elon win;
Good experience;
The interface is chaotic but the app runs smooth;
Twitter is far better than threads. Zuck is cuck . Zuck made copy of Twitter just removing photos from insta.;
I feel like ppl aren't jumping on board because they felt lost or uninvolved with a higher volume of Twitter content than real news, but we'll see.. it's target is open source so maybe it'll come together if we keep what we have to say together like it's the real point;
Exact twitter copy.. Zuck even sucking at copying.;
This app very good;
Justice for Elon musk;
So buggy! My feed and updated do not load.;
Ok lang para syang thread;
Nice;
Nobody engages with your posts on this app and you are not able to delete your profile. No longer interested in using this app.;
Bad;
Nothing beats OG Hail Twitter!;
great app;
Best;
Bad;
No freedom of speech;
The app closes on its own, that's why I can't finish what I'm about to post.;
Really shameful as it copied a already existed twitter app...;
Most bare bones app;
It's literally Twitter, but from Meta. So you already know your data is not safe and there is no free speech.;
Best üñ§;
Nice üíØ;
It is so smooth üòÖ;
Why everyone start sharing pictures on thread's;
A Liberal sh*thole. Not worth trying it. You'll be censored.;
I want to delete my thread account but when I do this thread was asking me to delete my Instagram account too.. this is a trap.. not satisfied with threads..;
NiceüòÉ;
I do think twitter is better than this;
It's GOOD üëç;
Nice;
nice üëç;
How are the re going yo changing my information again hacker do get away buy doing what do;
Dood app;
There is no option to join without using instagram. I'm trying to limit my exposure to social media and not spend my days browsing social internet like these vultures would like you to. This was only an expression of interest, I will move on.;
Copy App üòÉüòÉ;
Fix the feeds to only ppl you follow....;
The absolute worst. Deleted it 10 minutes after downloading.;
Boring!!!!! What's the point of an social media app if you wont get any response to stuff?;
Copy and paste of twitter with out free speechüòÜ;
Useless & a complete waste of time;
I only see posts from celebrities and news organization. I never see posts from the regular ppl I follow.;
Best of üíØ;
Lack of features that supports a discussion space like tags and better algorithm. Prematurely launched.;
bad apps;
bugged ui interface.....every thing gets blurry and overlapping...please fix these bugs ASAP.;
ew i need an insta account to use it;
"Need to improve algorithm. What makes twitter interesting is their homepage can show the most random yet funny tweets from ANYONE. In threads I only saw influencer or celebrity who ""trying"" to be funny but ending up cringe.";
Great App;
Introduce poles for voting;
Wtheck is this;
Threads can never replace Twitter.;
Good;
Awesome and Amazing;
can you add a double checker when you unfollow someone because i accidentally did and its annoying;
Please add account permanently delete option...;
Good;
I love it;
This app didn't works;
Awful;
3rd class copy of twitter;
Totally Wasted..;
Worst app ever;
Being trying to post threads for 20+ hours now. But keeps saying it has failed. No customer support or where to reach to complaint.;
nice üëç;
Not engaging enoughü´§;
There is no inbox option. Performance is not good.;
Ram ram bhai saab;
Zuck is a cuck;
My review can improve over time, but it needs alot of improvement... It crashes alot and shows some annoying things on my screen. Alot of un delivered post keep appearing on my screen and it's annoying.. I wish I could share my screen so you can see it;
Bad;
why does the app keep crashing when posting?;
This is op app for the Twitter users and use so let's download now;
Nice app;
Great app. Would have given a 5 star but my post keeps failing to upload for 2 days now. Pls fix or drop the android upgrade cos I see ios users talking about the new upgrade that comes with translation and other cool stuff;
Good social network. App is OK, but needs features like displaying latest threads chronologically and only from accounts you follow.;
Don't create new account and password I want to make for safe with password please why don't help me koo;
Better Than Twitter......;
Awful app, waste of time;
Meh this app sucks Twitter better;
Bad not good features avaliable pls update this features;
Copy paste (someone idea).;
The app is very good and lovely but it need some modification such as dark mode, DM, etc.;
May be Zuck should bring innovative ideas rather than copying Snapchat Twitter Tiktok features Plus the app isn't available in App Gallery;
I see posts from people I don't follow in my home timeline with no option to disable that. The promised ActivityPub support is still not available.;
Not bad;
Team Elon ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è;
Great enough for me;
R.harsha;
New experience;
It disabled my Instagram account;
Unstalling it today ,;
Zero star deta agar Mera bahut ghatiya hai per bahut jyada ghatiya apne aap ki baat bolo bahut badhiya hai;
The app needs more work. It constantly fails to upload upload and barely shows most of my posts and comments.;
Not user friendly as Twitter;
I cannot get this app to send notifications and I cannot get rid of Twitter until it does. Uninstalled/reinstalled. Logged out/logged in. Played with notification settings in app and in phone settings. Turned off battery optimization for app. No notifications.;
Extremely invasive. Collects way too much data for it to be even legal. Moreover, feels like a watered down dumbed out twitter;
This is good app but it occupied lot of storage;
Go download twitter dumbasss;
Nice;
Ok ok app;
If Meta wanted to go head to head with Twitter, they should have given us a better quality app. Hidden words do not work and the home feed is nothing but the same threads all day. I'm still seeing the same threads from 6 days ago. Twitter is the superior app.;

Very fine app it's easy to use posts notifications. I like the Thread!;
Very boring app and zuck is a cuck..;
Oomy god;
What is the point of words if it does not allow me to say things i want? Also very buggy;
Bahut jyada kharab app hai;

I am facing an issue with this application. Whenever I am trying to reply or quote a video the application shuts off by itself and that video disappears. It's happening from the day one that I had downloaded threads. Please fix that problem. Thank you.;
"Nice attempt on copying Twitter but I find some things not so comfortable in this app. For example, I can't separate posts in a feed between recommendations and my follows. It's just a huge list of endless publications from people I don't know and don't care about. Also it would be great to have ""save media"" button.";
Too many red flags;
Useless app can't even see single word on screen due to glitch.everything is overlap on each other.;
Worse app;

at first I like it but I started having a problem. It keeps closing. I'm not even done composing my caption. I couldn't upload the photos that I wanted to post because it keeps on stopping.

Twitter is better you lizard ü¶é;
It's pretty ok so far. If it gets better in later updates I MIGHT move from Twitter. Off the top of my head a few improvements you can make is adding a timeline for accounts you follow & let us make other customizable timelines, adding post search would be amazing. Normally I don't like Meta/Facebook products but honestly? As an artist I just want to get out of Twitter and still have a chance getting seen.;
It still lacks lots of features but there's hope for the future. I appreciate the competition it brings to the table.;
Chutia ap by mark juker tying to copy twitter;
Plz tell me, how can I log in if i m not an insta user....üëéüëéüëé;

This is very similar to the bird app, but without the rampant toxicity. It works well enough, but it does feel a bit light on features. Hopefully it will become better with time. Overall, I am really enjoying Threads.;
Akil_______ak47;
I'll reinstall when you can just see people you follow instead of completely random people;
It's just a Twitterised version of Instagram. Nothing more nothing else. And after a few weeks on its full of unwanted, unsavoury, bogus, fake-ish accounts that no one wanted and no one asked for. Since signing on all I've been doing is blocking and muting accounts. And the fact that it lacks so many features up until this day. Say what you will but I would rather stay in Twitter and Instagram.;
Needs a tablet UI option;
Worst app ever. So cringeüòë;
Showing a lot of promise. Just needs some added functions like the ability to search for topics you are interested in.;
waste;
Looks like cheap copy of instagram.... Not even bit closer to Twitter. Its so cheap my words cant explain it. I was excited for it but it ruined everything. Tooo cheap quality.;
Not good. You just doing copy paste of Twitter layout. do something new if you have otherwise don't waste your time and money.;
God Awful UI;
It's awful, no filters, you get banned for everything, you can look for interesting topics going back to Twitter well tbf I never left Twitter and will never do;

Annoying.. why am I forced to ee random people's thoughts that I could not care less about. Twitter you follow people you are interested in. Threads you are forced garbage. Oh and can't delete once you join.;
‚ù§Ô∏è;
Fake followers trick on threads;
This feels like a copy and pasted twitter;
Cheap knockoff of Twitter. Government censorship is the main feature of this app.;
Amazing experience so far but it really needs some basic stuff like gifs etc. I really hope we see more updates soon.;
Full Copy of twitter zucky bro why you only made a copy of Apps that are exist think different.;
"So far it's pretty peaceful. I appreciate that there's a pop up telling me that I might be posting something that could be deemed a problem(even if they're wrong), instead of the way FB will just arbitrarily ban me.

Disapointing by meta üòû;
It's like Twitter but way worse;
Absolute dogpoop;
Takes forever to load new... Threads? Twits? Moderation is as senseless as in Facebook. So much for the hype.;
Last 2week;

Update.. Still sucks after updates today July 19th. Just put it in chronological order like Twitter does and everything will be perfect I don't want to see threats from people I don't follow Seems nice but what the hell all I see is people that I don't follow I go check off thread only people I follow and yet I still see Toys R Us in my timeline like why I just want to see who I follow in chronological order of the time they send a message have the people who created this and never use Twitter?;

Pretty good for a first launch!! Its easy to use and self-explanatory and I'd say the algorithm is good as well. It has great *potential* but a few things need improvement: -the ability to use hashtags would make it easier to find topics and people you'd be interested in -an option for a following-only feed would be a major improvement (especially chronological order) -the ability to choose images from albums rather than recent photos -the ability to save photos to phone;
terrible can't create an acc without having Instagram;
It is not loading my posts saying something went wrong and suddenly shutting down while texting.. Very annoying and interesting. I cannot use it..;
Too simple;
Excellent. The UI was clean and the navigations were easy. There was few minor bugs encountered. The app was stable and the experience was seamless. Very easy to reach out to connections and people. Very similar its competitor, twitter.;

Stopped working 2 days in. 2 days and now everything I try to post or comment on just says it fails. Tried repeatedly reaching support. They basically have none as far as I can tell not that Meta is known for good customer service or anything.;
Worst app ever built in entire human history, This application doesn't deserve a single star rating.;
I didn't like the app Twitter is wayyy better;
Nice apps;
üòÇ;
I don't want an Instagram account. I have face why not give a Facebook link also. I use to like Twitter;

was enjoying, thought great an app that will replace my large Twitter one that I stopped going on because of the bs. then 1 week into it, I get suspended with no explanation other than I have violated content rules( I had not yet posted anything, only reposted) and to appeal or even open app I must enter a code sent to my phone # only it never comes.

Does not put info from the people you follow in your feed. You get what the app wants to show you and it doesnt do a good job at picking what you would like to see EDIT: Getting better;
A good platform for content creators;
It kept crashing, especially when writing a new thread. I was repeatedly put off because of this and closed the app entirely. Hopefully it's fixed in a future update, I'll update my review once this app stops crashing.;
I'll start by saying I've enjoyed being on threads, when I can get on it that is, as it just crashes constantly, always when I'm trying to reply to people. And the problem is it crashes, I then have to remember who I was talking to or the thread I was on and find it again. Only for it to crash again and again and again. I'm at the point where its unusable in its current state. Needs a lot of work.;

Not good app;
A hundred failed threads per bolt because the people using them felt like they were thrown into a dry desert, the man who owns meta is the most ignorant man in the world because he didn't ask himself what is the purpose of threads. threads will go where google + went;
Too many pictures on the feed very very few actual threads;

I believe that this app has potential, but there are a few features missing that would make the experience better. One feature that should be implemented is an explore tab, where you can find threads from people you do not follow. There could also be a tab that shows you popular threads at the time.;

Worst app;
Nonnnn;
Love the interface but the app keeps on crashing. I also opted not to sync my instagram contacts to threads so I can have a fresh start of choosing who to follow but it keeps on suggesting/showing too many accounts in its home tab.;
Would be a lot better if there was a chronological order and a what's trending in the world so if an event happens users will be able to see it in real time.;

Don't install!!!;
Features are non existent. Literally I don't know how this has 50 million downloads. Nobody is on it at all and my feed isn't anybody in following. Alot is to be desired.;
Love the app ... One thing I would like is the volume on the videos being easier to select as on .. and once it's on for one, stays on for all until I turn it off. Also, I know they have more to come like better search features. Oh, and if I could see more of who I follow on my feed, rather than your 'suggestions' ... That would be nice üëç If you are Threads development reading this, I'm using Android,... Oh and GIFs. I have to use an app, save them and post them rather th. The keyboard on my üì±;

Can't see any replies to any threads. It always says something went wrong;
Has a long way to go, why release something that clearly has many problems but guess it was released to clobber other such apps.?;
Trash;
I could have done without this. It's basically Twitter for your Instagram. Listen, that's great but none of what I'm seeing on my main feed is stuff from people I follow. It's just a bunch of useless stuff. Please make it so I only see stuff from people I follow.;
‚ù§Ô∏è;
Absolutely horrible. Within minutes my freedom of speech was sensored.;
I don't need suggestions .i wanna see what i want .not what the app showed me;
Worst copy to imitate the the users of Twitter;
I hate that we need to login with an Instagram account. I don't want an Instagram account, poorly developed!!! The proper way to develop this is by creating a main Meta account, and using SSO to login each app. In your Meta User settings, the user should be able to choose which apps their Meta account can access, so they should be able to activate or disable FB, IG, Horizon, and Threads.;
It's blocked in the EU. Apart from that also I have read comments about crash and so on. Probably, Threads owners started in the wrong moment. Being patient always brings quality.;
Good;
It's Twitter. It's literally just Twitter. If you like Twitter this is fine. If you hate Twitter you'll hate this. Simple as that.;
Delete your threads account, you will loose your Instagram. Really ?! F...K Instagram;
feed of junk, goodbye;
Gay app;
I wasnt getting notifications for my messages, I turned off this app and I started to get audio notifications...;
Sure, there will be some issues with a new app. Including features that others are demanding. Give the team some time please! Threads is already superior than other similar platforms.;
Kind like a Twitter knockoff and really just an extension of Instagram vs anything new.;
A lot like both Instagram and Facebook; Useless.
Threads and Instagram are practically the same thing,the only difference is that threads is limited to posts and photos,the only thing missing to make it Instagram is messaging,reels etc. Not everyone will agree but it's practically the same as Instagram. This is my opinion;
N√£o consigo fazer um post, sempre da erro;
Refreshing!;
Need more features that twitter doesn't have;
Not good;

Good app;
bloody apps its disconting dont Download or use this apps because its waste your time.;
So buggy. Gets stuck like every 2 minutes. Not recommended;
Its cool but here are some issues i see. First off you have no hashtags, you cant search topics, no dm feature, you cant add a backdrop picture. First week you could share a link and the thumbnail would show. Today it only show the link in preview and then minimizes to just the link when posted....something people are less likely to click on. Some people are not dealing with that issue. Cant claim you have an app that will allow more EXSPOSURE and things like that are missing or glitching out.;

"The best explanation for a ""threads app"" refers to a software application that enables users to engage in threaded conversations or discussions. In the context of computer programming and software development, a threads app typically involves the use of multithreading, a programming technique that allows a single process to execute multiple threads concurrently. Here's a more detailed explanation: Threaded Conversations: In the context of social media or messaging platforms, a threads atreder";

Great;
This app keeps saying get ready for threads and nothing happened so I'm not holding my breath or anyting or trying to be disrespectful but was supposed to happen I keep waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and it just keeps saying wait are you ready for threads are you ready for threads I get some build up to some great thing like somebody needs to fix whatever is going on in this piece of s*** have it right get it tight or get this s*** off my site and outta my damn site;
Good but Urgently need the messaging and audio conversation room like Twitter spaces üòï;
The best app in the game by a light year;
Garbage copy of twitter;

It asked me to logim with Instagram but I don't have any Instagram account. It should have options to sign up using phone number or email id. This app is a cheap version of Twitter.;
Just a bunch of left wing bots;

better than twitter for sure! more safe and inclusive.;

Seems like a copy of another app nothing innovative;
copy paste for twitter and after install you can't delete it hate this app;

"I liked the app a lot, but since a week ago it doesn't work properly on my device, and I get a message ""something went wrong"" whenever I try to view a profile, comments or activities.

Need more features and less censorship;
The permissions that this access and the terms and conditions we should agree with is really scary. It's just stealing our whole damn personal data.;
Ji ho 100x;
Its better than Twitter;
boring ahh app;

There needs to be a way to turn off auto playing video, and there needs to be a chronological feed with only posts and shares from people I follow.;
A complete worst app;
It's just garbage;
Twitter copy;

It's great;
Good.... We need web version of this;
Literally a copy of Twitter ü§¢ü§Æ;
Nice app;
This is very alternative for the blue bird app. It's actually fun and less toxic but there's some features that are still missing 1. Following Tab, as much as I like seeing people's threads, I wanna see the one I followed. 2. Hashtags, I mean if you wanna trend something you gotta use that. 3. Trending, I'm sorry I'm so used to looking at what's the trends ATM 4. Functional Search button. Not only the person you can search but pretty much everything;
"So is this app available in the EU or not? Because I was able to download it and follow a bunch of pages just fine, but now it's just ""something went wrong"" all the time. What's up?";

I installed that day when it launched. It's similarly Twitter and attractive app and totally nice;
"""Sorry, something went wrong. Try again. "" My entire threads experience.";
Worst app;
So many issues. I couldn't see my own profile page, other people page, my replies, notifications, etc. The only thing working for me is the feed, which filled from a bunch of accounts I'm not following. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still runs into the same problem. I'm using Google pixel pro.;
App sucks twitter is better.;
OP pro;
I love the app so far But they should please put the dm option for us;
Extremely poor. Just copied twitter. World don't need this app.;
Off brand Twitter fraud and scam used on this app;
Copied the concept of Twitter under Meta umbrella. Needs to be more innovative.;
A trap for instagram users if you download this you then can't delete this account or your insta account will be also deleted.;
It's ok. The post and feed are not loading. It's been like this for a few days now.;
New app new technology;
Very bad;
IT'S COMING FROM TOKYO WAY WXIII PATLABOR THE MOVIE 3 2002 SPRING;
Threads gives a sets a perfect example that if you product is poor, no godly amount of money on advertisement will help you make that business thrive. Threads is that poor products, who had Instagram to promote it but it failed badly coz it was just dogshit and unnecessary app;
Boring;
Kindly provide an option to login without an Instagram account.;

I really love this app, but dear Devs, please help: I was in the zone with the bad internet, where I got an error saying that the feed cannot be loaded. But when I came home, the problem didn't disappear. And unfortunately, I still cannot post for some reason, see my threads and likes. I cleaned cache, reinstalled the app, checked the network access. How can I solve this?;
Trash;
Kindly Add Dark Theme;
Stripped down, zero ads, focused, clean, and overall very positive. Having a lovely time.;
This app is very good to use because this app got 50M+ Users in 1 month this app upload on 1 may 2023;
Just trash. Absolutely pointless app, and now I can't delete my account without losing my Instagram.;
Same as every other social media.;
For Instagram people not for twitter people;
"there's no ""create account"" button?? it just says ""log in with Instagram"" i don't have instagram";
My experience has been of half naked tasteless woman and perverted men and I will be discouraging anyone to use it... Matter of fact I have posted my horrible experience on social media... I will try to make it go viral;
Another way of extracting data and making the user useless in life;

I'm enjoying it, but desperately needs hashtag support and why aren't URLs showing the featured image associated with them anymore? Without that, it's basically just Instagram and we don't need two of those.;
Just a cheap copy of Twitter It is like twitter but then also notthing like twitter;
To be honest I'm enjoying this app but the fact is the restriction is too much when ever you follow someone then they restricte ur account it very bad. Let take it that this is a new app so we are all strangling to get followers and it not easy I think you should take down the restriction down for now;
Exactly like Twitter in a sense of posting thoughts, feelings, memes, and promotions, but different in a sense that I have yet to see any pop culture drama, I have yet to see any discrimination, or cyber-bullying. Threads is safe so far!!;
Copy paste üòÅ;

Don't get the purpose. F Boring;
This app doesn't even have good features! It just got fame due to Twitter's outage. App UI is horrible! Doesn't even have stuff to do in here. Only good thing is that it uses your Instagram ID as login and you have the option to follow all the people you followed in Instagram, that's a neat feature! APP WILL DIE WITHIN 6 MONTHS!;
Really usefulness üòá;
"It would be great if I were able to follow back people. Their ""spam trap"" has me as a false positive. I have submitted a support ticket 3 times & replied to their Thread about the problem several times, but no response. It's beyond frustrating and I'm almost ready to delete my account. If the problem gets fixed, I'll add more stars to my rating and change my review.";
Not soo... good the followers have very hard...not like Instagram...üôÇ;

Apply the option of threads to the home page of Instagram;
When I log in to instagram, the threads log out. Vice versa. Because of this, my instagram was violated and I couldn't interact with my friends.I can't even comment, like or follow.

Provide an (accept all / confirmed all ) option to accept followers request for open account on treads like Instagram ( anyone can follow open account without admin confirmation). If an account have followers in thousands or millions then what will he/she do ? . Should he/she click on confirm option for thousands or millions times to accept followers request;
Problem #1.) censorship. Problem #2.) Owned by Meta. Meta doesn't realize, it's going to go bankrupt soon! Censorship and cancel culture does not sell! These applications are not for facts, they are for entertainment. Releasing applications in 2023 that control the information that you post, is extremely harmful for democracy and freedom of speech. On that note, you can literally say J. Biden cured cancer and they won't ban you. But!, You go against their narrative they shut you up like Nazis..;

Need to fix the bugs on the app. Can't load my profile, can't make a post, can't refresh my page. Also, maybe consider allowing users to download media straight from the timeline;
After using for many days i reconsider my 4 star and I will now give this app 1 star if I could give 0 stars i would gived this app become cringe day by day no creativity in their threads i dislike this app so much just shutdown it;

Any potential thia app once had may have been wasted. Meta clearly rushed this app out the door without giving time to plan out and release updates at a good rate. It is ridiculously hard to grow on the app or see posts your actually intrested in. They don't even have an actual discovery tab or following tab. The apps been out for weeks now and has had virtually no changes. The lack of updates has killed any fun this app once had.;

Simply not working. My internet connection is working fine but the app just keep loading. Tried to uninstall then reinstall but the problem persisted.;

There's still a lot to fix in this app. The unnecessary restrictions are just too much and it's making the app look a lot like a child's play...;

Log in via Instagram only? But it's for adults, business Entrepreneurs... I don't have and won't have Instagram, I don't have time for that;
Very very nice app and good luck work;

A lot better than Twitter. But it would be better if you didn't have to log in with Instagram;
It's good app But it should have some features like when i post any thread it have option like 1. Post to public 2. Post to public + friends 3 post private. Then definitely thread app will overcome Twitter üëçüèª;

Terrible. Censorship anti free speech. Algorithm is not open source, not relevant, nor interesting. Inflated artificial activity because it's tied to Insta. Meta does not value privacy, to them you are the product. App requires too many permissions.;

why?why? what's the point of a text based platform?when you are allowing the user to use it just like instgram;
such a buggy app... videos don't play sounds;
The lack of options when it come to seeing unwanted content you are not following is annoying. If I like certain things the app will bombard me with a bunch of similar content that I'm really not interested in. I try with this app but it got more and more frustrated as I keep on using it. I really wish there was an option to block certain things in my timeline not just in replies.;
Twitter Copycat.;
Theres still more that needs to be done, I love the idea of a meta intagrated social spsce but the UI still lacks that flare and i need to be able to control my feed in the near future;

Serious lack of basic features. I had to crawl back to Twitter. Also, you can't delete it lest you delete your Instagram account, beware. Do not get this app unless you are content with losing every other app account owned by Meta;

So I tried getting onto the app today and it wouldn't let me and instead made me have to do an appeal with verification to prove its me. I submitted it and they just put a message saying thanks and to wait until the appeal is finished being reviewed to see whether or not I can regain access to my account. Says if they find its not me that it will be permanently disabled which is bs! Hope they fix this and let me back on my account!;

great app but it would be better if on the following list, you'll see the accounts that doesn't follow you so it's easy to unfollow them and not having to check every accounts. also for Instagram!!! like pleaseeee;
Useless social media app. Fully similar look like 50% Twitter and 50% Instragram. And I have both of app. So why I use this app. Totally boring application. I can't spend my time on this app. So finally I uninstalled this boring app.üòµ‚Äçüí´üëéüñï;

"Why anyone would give this more than one star given how bad it is? And I don't care if it's just ""starting out."" They had a chance to make this good at launch, KNOWING their competition at twitter, take the good parts from twitter and IMPROVE on it. But they didn't. Also considering this is owned by FB/Instagram, I'm not expecting this to get any better. Already bad enough I see posts from people THAT I DON'T FOLLOW, instead of the people I DO follow. So much for a ""twitter killer.""";
Better than Twitter;

Very bad app. Instagram is good but Threads won't be like Twitter.;

Try to come up with your own idea..it's a copycat of Twitter..plus forces you to Instagram account.and takes hell lot of permissions than it should. Influencers pls stay away from this app. Incase if you want to close ur account with threads. You'll have to close Instagram account too.;
Just average;
Don't download this is a trap;
What's the usecase of this app? Why would someone need 2 Instagrams?;
Boring;
Very good;
"Lmao y'all copied Twitter and said ""do better"" and i love it";
This platform is an undercooked turd. Literally everything you hate about Instagram is distilled down into something even more annoying. This is a content graveyard. It is where posts go to die. I even offered to give away $1000 if I could get to 50 followers in 3 days, and got ZERO engagement. Don't waste your time with this garbage. At least on Twitter, it feels like you're talking to somebody... Twitter is bad because of the people. Threads is bad because it's a bad platform.;

No autoplay settings not as smooth as twitter and it's kinda dumb sometimes. It should have been somethin good for news. But it's apparently not.;
Nothing new;
A terrible app that nobody needed. Nothing works here as it should. The UI is cluttered, with ads all over the pages and the reels integration is a nightmare. Talking about Privacy in context to Meta is a lost cause so I won't dwell much on that.;
Nice app but i am having problem i can follow another account why is it like that;
This is very good app.;
Zuckerberg try something new, stop copying others, Tiktok = Instagram, Twitter = Threads;
It can still be better if more features are added. 3 stars for first experience.;

I guess developers took advantage of FOMO and open source code of Twitter. This app is like an github clone project of Twitter. Feels polished but no engagement, no new stuff and only followed content is promoted. Learn from twitter and be better if you want a piece of this cake.;

It's the same.. what's the point;
Rubbish copy of Twitter. It completely useless. Uninstalling it;
Twitter was going to the dogs, so I left, this came along, I liked it's ease of use, it isn't a slanging match, I had no high expectations and it's exceeded them easily.;
I don't have Instagram account and I'm unable to login by other way. How can I login without Instagram account.;
Allow users to register on the app without necessarily having to operate Instagram. The current model is intrusive. It hard to anonymously use your app like one does on twitter. Delink registration from Instagram. That's the primary reason why I uninstalled the app without registering. You're making it very easy to trace people;

the whole app is a cheap imitation of twitter. Can't even post things properly.;
This app's fatal flaw is it's feed. Almost everytime I go on Threads, my feed is entirely made up of random people I do not follow and do not care about meaning I'll turn off the app almost immediately. This entire app would be saved by splitting the tabs into a following and a discovery one. Right now, it's not worth it.;

A Twitter clone that is in internal closed alpha stage. The app sucks big time. Lacks on features and polish. Recommender algorithm straight up sucks. It almost feels like non existent. I guess it wasnt something meta invested in wholeheartedly. Also the biggest bummer is the Instagram mindset of the users. People can't be forced to morph into the forum like UX it provides. Absolutely no reason to switch from Twitter or Mastodon. Also no data transparency.;

Absolute crash-fest on android, though not on my ipad. Hate the fact there is no search by hash tag function. My feed is nowhere near as relevant to my interests (which I have clearly indicated by my follows, likes etc) as it should be. I mean, it's also not good to be stuck in an echo chamber, but threads should know my taste very well by now, since a) I'm migrating from Insta b) both apps, particularly Threads, harvest an egregious amount of data from users;

I am on a Samsung tablet and for the past few days my posts and quoted posts fail to upload. I need help and sending a message to @zuck and @meta does not go through, because all my posts are failing. I deleted and reinstalled this app, to no avail. It seems I can repost only.;

Needing an Instagram account to sign up is horrible, I won't use the app until I can make a unique Threads account.;

Hi trends I'm just wondering why I can't use hastag on threads app;
warst;
*successfully copied twitter* With more personal data expose and more often ads coming soon...just like any other meta app. I still dont get why would they even require such sensitive info...not even gonna use anyway for personalized threads... it's just to sell it for ad companies and make money Traaashhh...;
Great potential but some fixes needed. I don't get notifications from some of the people I want to know when they have posted, I can't attach GIFS, I see a lot of accounts I don't follow and don't want to follow and have to spend so much time blocking and muting.;

I am happy with the app so far. I wish that there were a few other features, like a favorites list or following tab so that I could switch back and forth. It is nice to be able to see people with similar interests and not be buried under bots and other hateful content. I am looking forward to future updates.;
So bad üòû;
I am enjoying using threads. I only wish I could tailor the post that appear on my homescreen to be more about what I like. Also, wish I could schedule or save posts I'm making for later. Also, I think it would be cool if you could try to make some widgets to be used on the homescreen of phones. Currently not having any luck of being noticed at all on the platform. Please make it easier somehow for smaller threads users to get noticed.;
Why would I need threads when I already have an instagram account which looks similar to the threads. Threads need some out of the box features which really makes us excited.;
No Trending like twitter , also I don't like Zuckerberg aa there will obviously be no free speech;

I had high hopes for this app. Unfortunately there is way too many bugs that makes the user experience poor. Threads is also lacking on lots of features that Twitter currently has. The censorship and invasive data collection is also a big downside. The marketing made me believe threads would rival Twitter but I just don't see that happening. Threads needs a big revamping in order to actually compete with Twitter.;
Not good.. copy of twitter;
Enjoy the App;
Good;
This is just entertainment only not compare twitter;
Bugged out application.;

Honestly, this app is so far a solidly good app, but I wish you guys could let me and the rest of us on here to change our profile without importing Instagram profile pictures.;
Nice;
Amazing ü§©;
Thank you;
Worst app don't use it Better use Twitter and won't allow a cheap copy of a great app exist in my application list;
Very bad;
Not too bad so far it feels a little barren in comparison to some other websites and apps but it has potential The quality control and filtering need some work And i'd like more control over the timeline of stuff I see but it's a start;
ü§ßü§ß;
This is a pointless add on. Seriously just give it up that Twitter beat you at the thread game. People who use Instagram really do not care about threads af of they do they already use Twitter. The interface is also bland the vid posts look clunky with the text posts and the interface just makes the expernce a treasure hunt that you did not want to go on. Scroll across nope! Just down and down and oops missed a post up up up. Hey where did the feelng in my thumb go?;

Bugs still not fixed and it has been a while now since launch. Pasting attempt, it highlights the first section when attempting to paste at end of message. New line half way through message creates a new thread in a thread. Large images still probably crash the phone. Cannot have feed for just followers. Hashtags don't do anything e.g. don't change colour, not searchable. Etc etc. Happy to update rating once fixed. S23Ultra 1Tb.;

Runs well and is easier to use than twitter while not as much content as older social media (this is to be expected for a young app) it is easy to use and set up shows great promise;
App policy is terrible;
Not good at all, doesn't provides uh a dekstop or web version, crashes alot and made it so annoying that if uh join this then it's compulsory to have ur account activated otherwise if uh r gonna deactivate it, uh will end up loosing ur ig account too,as both of them would be deleted simultaneously. You'll end up regretting ur decision to create an account on this.;
Better than Instagramüëèüëè;
So far, so good. It's still in the early stages, and more features are being created as it's used, but so far, the experience has been great, and the community is supportive, positive, and helpful. There seems to be a concerted effort on the new users to block disinformation, hate speech, racism, and focus on sharing facts and real news.;

It's look like duplicate of Twitter application, but I believe you have to work on image click bug. Whenever we are clicking on any image then instead of zooming like in Twitter image is getting little bit up and down (like vibration). So just amend some parameters in image click it will improve your application.;

Data looting;
I love it this app;
Update: Finally the issue have been resolved. It is running smoothly. Firstly from Day 1 the app is glitchy with overlapped posts and dragged screens. I haven't seen the actual interface till now. Secondly now it says that my instagram account will be deleted if I delete Threads. That's totally unfair. On one hand I can't use Threads and on the other hand I can't delete it. So I am left with last option of uninstalling it. I was so excited at first but now I am totally disappointed.;

Supar aap;
A clearly well built app on a technical level, but god is it just so lame. Its like twitter (obv) except people only tweet Instagram captions with no picture. The lack of a trending tab, while making the app less doomery, also makes threads feel less interconnected and social.;
Without searchable hashtags its really not a viable alternative;

My fave bird app is no more so I signed up here. Since I don't like the main feed filled with people/accounts I have no interest in and do not follow and since Instagram already has it, can you please have it so we can see our Following and Favorites easier? Please also have an option to Save the thread like Instagram posts. Thx.;
It needs a group chat feature to share tweets with friends. It also needs an explore/search feature to stay up to date with the latest news/trends/tweets. And finally, a feature to unlink my insta account to allow creation of anonymous accounts. Add these and it'll overtake twitter.;
Boring;
App is useless when I all I see is random posts from people and topics I don't know or care about. Why can't I just see people I Follow and in chronological order?;

This is amazing. ‚ù§ Very easy to uninstall;
I just tried it and this is my opinion. I would give it a zero if it was there cuz its just a worse copy of twitter. And what si that layout like I'm not a left handed. Meta just has taken twitter and made everything diffrent on their style and suddenly made it worse. Switch to twitter it is way simpler and better!;
Copy paste from twitter;
Not great, needs Instagram to use. No thanks;
It doesn't matter who you follow, everyone's posts go on your wall and you have to physically block the 100 million you don't want to see one at a time. They Zuckered it up real good. 1 billion ads.;

Ben this app;
A lot of potential, but it's still way too buggy. It's also way too sensitive on its auto-ban system. I'll follow 10 people, and then can't follow anyone else for at least 24 hours. Hoping Meta fixes all the issues soon so that I don't have to leave and come back later. Updating to say that they never respond in any way when you report an issue. 0 actual support.;

Buggy. Also can't even change name without changing Instagram;
There is no hashtags it's just the same as Instagram;
Cool;
It is getting good;
"Over a week now and can't post anything. ""sorry, something went wrong""";
Better than Elon's app.;
Good app ..üëç;
Very great app;
Copy cat;
It's just poorest of poorest public failure ever;
Keeps throwing me out everytime I try to open the app. Support isn't helpful;
cheap;
Worst app don't download .This is a cheating after removing thread account Instagram account also been deleted;
Just launched app.. surely has glitches.. but as soon i log in ..the entire interface goes haywire & overlaps each other making it a matrix of lines full of distortion.;
Worst experience. Not a single viewer or like comments... useless app;
twitter but without the fun, features, or real people.;
"I just noticed that sorting the ""earliest and latest"" following has been enabled but still doesn't make it easier to fish out who follows back or not. The following should be seen from the page instead of the user's profile to verify. Another thing is the app keeps glitching when you try to see who's following back and following back doesn't seem easy afterwards.";
Idk man seems and looks like an app from the 90's;
Super app;
Nithinlucky;
Twitter is going down, hopefully meta does a decent job at maintaining this app lmao, instagram got a really big homophobia problem and lacks moderation but this seems decent ngl;
Evert since I downloaded this app, my Facebook, PayPal, and Instagram keep getting hacked. I'm having to change passwords every day on each. Plus, when I tried to load pictures, it won't let me. Uninstalling;
I love ‡§•‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§° @shanianimations;
, happy when am using this app;
Nice app, 2 in one, like Twitter as well as Instagram.;
Owsome. Brlient!;
Doesn't let you just see posts from people you follow in the order they were posted. This is like the most basic function in the world, but Threads can't do it.;
Instagram Dinesh Hhhj Nnm;
Good app;
Nice but followers nhi aata isaliye use nhi kr rhiii;
I have Instagram installed on my phone. The same username and password is not working in this app.;
I like it ü§ç;
There's no real purpose to this app. It's stuck somewhere between instagram and twitter. Useless at the moment;
No information from the user.;
Useless try to be a copy. Nothing new. Cant delete or leave registering as connected with fb insta etc. Wasted time and money. Could make anything else useful for humanity;
Try something original;
Brilliant;
Garbage! App worked fine for a day, and then I woke up this morning and I can view people's posts but I can't view any replies, or leave a reply, or see my notifications. Sent support ticket but it's gone unanswered. This is total junk!;
Welcome change from the usual clutter on the bird app!;
Most Useless App Ever. Can't even pin a thread to one's profile. It needs work and update and until then, I won't recommend downloading it;
Elon ma;
Very waste app;
Flop app;
Useless app;
Imagine copying Twitter;

I don't delete my account;
I enjoy it but the search feature sucks. Why can't i look up topics? I can only look up people? How am i supposed to find new people and things if i cant search for stuff other than usernames?;
Very disappointed;
Whole User experience is worst;
'Sorry something went Wrong' I literally can't use it.;
When trying to post on Threads, I often get message that my post failed to post, even though it says that anyone can respond.;
Very nice application;
The best app and good by for the dead bird!;
seriously This app is sucks;
Worst app It's purely copy of Twitter and it's not worth it it's just a strategy of mark for taking down our personal information to sell it, yet from one more app(i.e threads);
Im sorry but the app is ah me;
Love;
Worst knock off of Twitter or X;
Osm;
Why can't I have a page to follow only those I follow without having to see other posts/threads I don't care about?;
Updated... 25--07-2023;
To much stuff on Ui;
Nice. Helpful;
Very good üëçüèª;
Why would is this app forcing us to keep our thread acc when i really don't wanna it's like violating our right to choose what we want;
Op app;
Honestly it's a great app except for the fact that if you delete ur threads account, your Instagram account goes with it. That needs to be fixed especially if you just wanna take a break from threads and deactivate for a while, whilst still having access to your Instagram account.;
It's a meta¬© product.;
Lumayan buat iseng2 lah. Bisa post video yg durasinya 5 menit lebih. Terus perbaiki tampilan & fiturnya Zuck biar makin keren.;
I don't like this app;
Racist app ü§¢;
Lmfao so this is just a copy of twitter ü§£ü§£ü§£;
Doesnt go anywhere,, very little content,, just a bunch of talentless people asking you to follow them, lazy;
Awful. Immediately full of Influencers I'd never follow and awful political people. This was on day one! Uninstalled so I keep Instagram. Do better.;
Huge privacy concerns;
Itz a good aap but meta you have to give private chats alsoüòê;
zuck sucks;
Bad app;
Boring app;
Needs a lot more tools but is still amazing.;
Basic at the moment but no issues and can't wait for the features in the pipeline;
Copy paste;
Very bad ap;
bad experience;
Very good üôÇ;
Good enough Twitter clone;
I like it;
Tolong lah di home/timeline/beranda yg keluar itu akun yg kita ikuti, bukan acak gajelas begitu;
It's got a ways to go regarding features,but after trying several other similar apps it's got a strong start. I'm sure with enough time it will be even better.;
Add an option to turn on dark mode manually. It is useful when I want to use light mode in system but want to use dark mode in certain apps like threads;
This is better and very nice it's better than tweeter;
Wow üò≤;
People never learn. Leave proprietary garbage behind. Install mastodon;
The only way this replaces (or even contends with) Twitter/X is if every single xcorp server simultaneously goes offline. There's NO control over the feed, with the entire thing feeling like a stripped down version of Facebook. I expect nothing and I'm still disappointed;
Just cool;
Wow üëå Unique interface;
Bad;
Twitter is best than you lolll;
Sar please enable my Instagram reels option please üôèüôèüôèüôè 1 month hogaya mara reels option nahi araha kya karunu;
Genuinely the worst social media app ever designed - following people is absolutely meaningless as there is no way to view only posts by people you follow. Whoever thought this was a good idea needs to be fired, and then hopefully never hired ever again.;
It's not useful;
Good aap;
Feed extremamente bagun√ßado e falta features basicas;
Best app for Twitter üôÇüòÅ;
Good;
Haved little bugs and no have direct üòÉüòÉ;
Not good, unless you're really invested into instagram there's not much it offers. I made an account and was just immediately bombarded with constant political garbage and just countless threads mocking twitter. It just has no good original content and it doesn't promote creativity. The fact it boasts heavy moderation and censorship just makes it even more bland and boring and just leaves it one-sided echo chamber for politics and lame, sanitized jokes.;
U can call ü§ôü§ôü§ô;
Musk has done a great job getting people to resent Twitter. Now it is up to Threads to keep them happy with the new app.;
good;
Nice;
I give thread only one star but it is not deserve any star this app is not give you any view. And nothing;
Its Twitter form alt account;
pretty good app!! it was so much more experience about it!!;
Rubbish keeps crashing, before log in;
ŸÉÿ´Ÿäÿ± ÿ≠ŸÑŸà;
So bored app;
I love Threads! It's so cool!;
It's missing features that should have been included on release, but it's actually trying to improve unlike it's competitor which is actively destroying itself;
I don't really get the point of this app. Meta needs to consolidate Facebook, Instagram, and Threads into just one platform. They have too many platforms, and I just wind up using very little of any of them.;
I just downloaded the update but I don't see the following tab;
I like it.;
Copyright;
Much better than Twitter üòÅ;

Great start, but it is missing some features that could make it better.;
App freezes when accessing a post via an external link. Need Alt Text. Otherwise good!;
Bad content;
horrible App I have ever seen in my entire life so many glitches I have found in this app and I don't like it's concept that necessarily you have to link your Instagram account with this threads appüò† I would say that Twitter is far better than threads Instagram;
Very bad;
Twitter Copy;
Suggestions photo saved option Add kijiye;
ÿÆÿ±;
No features worth installing;
This is terrible, lots of content o don't care, the people seems like bots, nothing interesting, I cloud just pass years hiding content I don't like and it even will show more;
U guys should figure out how we can safely uninstall this App without erasing our instagram accounts first;
you gotta sign in with instagram. immediate 1 star;
Keep Holding search bar icon, open search pop-up like instagram.;
Better than twitter bird;
No Elon. 5 stars;
Please make it as a stand alone app. I don't have an Instagram account and I don't want to create one. But I want to use threads. I am giving only one star as if now, only to post this.;
Need a feed based on time posted. Wanna see nost recent;
I'm not a right wing nut; so it's great.
"Glad to see a ""following"" tab, as the inital feed upon launch was full of irrelevant posts from people I do not, nor would like to follow. Annoyingly the following tab option is hidden, you must press the threads logo as at the top of the page. And it is forgotten when closing the app. So you must remember to select the following tab each time you open the app.";
Not bad;
Nice app ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è;
Nice app appreciate thread team;
Great app üòÅ thank you mark for making this app i always heated twitter;
Excellent compared to the dead Tweeter;
literally only verified accounts would show up on my feed;
Still lacks lots of features;
July 25 update says 2 ways to customize feed. Maybe on iOS but I just downloaded and it isn't yet available on Android!!!;
"Really enjoying this ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try again."" simulator! Super realistic. Nothing ever works, can't post text or images, 10/10";
Super;
Can not delete threads account? Why?;
Instagram but black cover;
Perfect;
X the everything app is the best in the entire face of planet.üê¶‚úñÔ∏èüí™;
It works fine in my experience however there are random memes, videos and on my feed from accounts I don't follow and are not interested in. I mute these accounts however similar style posts from other accounts pop up instead. It would be nice if the amount of those kind of posts were reduced. Additionally the addition of a trending page would be good too.;
Dont use. This app is a privacy nightmare.;
I love you Instagram üåπ‚ù•‚ù•‚ù•I miss you Instagram all time I like you I love you üåπ‚ù•‚ù•‚ù•very much nice‚ù•‚ù•‚ù•üåπ;
Please enlarge or increase spacing btwn Like, Comment, Repost, and Share icons. And the Mute/Unmute button is aggravatingly small. Improve those two things & it's ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê;
It amazing ü§©;
Just works so smoothly, especially compared to Twitter.;
Useless;
Can't wait to see the app progress;
Getting better. Now we have image folders and can see avatars but I'm still reading posts of people I don't follow which sucks big time.;
Can you add an option to select dark mode like on Twitter/X;
I just dislike zuxx;
Ojal√° no supere a Twitter, ya que si sucede eso, meta seguir√° comport√°ndose como un maldito monopolio, como siempre lo ah hecho con sus creadores;
Trash;
gae app lol;
Why do you need insta for this? Weird gatekeeping;
You can't start an account unless you have an Instagram account. I get scam messages for Instagram daily;
This app is very familiar to me and super easy to use. It's like Twitter without as many glitches and the other chaos now associated with that app. If you like Twitter, you'll love Threads. They are adding more features, so remember it is brand new (as of this review). One thing they need to update (and I'm hearing they will) is that the home Feeds tab doesn't necessarily show new posts from the accounts I follow. It's a combination of accounts I follow mixed with a bunch of random accounts.;
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è;
üëç;
Its amazing. Not a single right wing nut job or Trump bot in sight. No hate. Just people getting along. For now..;
Copy;
"I CONTINUE TO NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE APP!! WAS ONLY ABLE TO USE IT FOR THE FIRST WEEK, AND SINCE THEN IT'S JUST ""SORRY, SOMETHING WENT WRONG""... REPORTED MULTIPLE TIMES, NO ANSWER! NOTIFICATIONS ARE BLANK, PROFILE THREADS ARE BLANK, CANNOT POST OR REPLY TO THREADS... FIX THIS!!! IT'S BEEN OVER 2 WEEKS!!";
Boring;
"I still can't customize my feed, and even if I could, ""people I follow"" should be a permanent setting. Without that, I won't be using Threads.";
Nice app;
Thats great app ..;
Bring back twitter;
Nice üí´;
Beats the hell out of sXitter already!;
Delete this app, it is useless.;
Need translations;
if it has dark mode it would be nice;
Nice App üëåüèª;
I would say add a trending page or something to see what's been popular topic on thread. It will feel more engaging overall. That's my only request so far.;
I have not been able to get a copy of threads, why not? Thank you Google. Joseph Johnson;
So fed up with not being able to follow for over a week and no end in sight. Thinking about abandoning the app. I do not recommend this app.;
Excellent üëç;
Honestly no reason to continue using it;
Its meh;
full of sucks;
Nice üòä app üòÉ;
I download this app because of nctü§≠üòå but i can't upload any photo, whyyyy. *problem has been solved. thank you*;
Okok.. but it really requires edit option...;
I like it;
I've downloaded the newest version but NONE of the updates promised in the What's New section are present.;
It's a copy paste of Twitter and Instagram Instagram face Twitter body it's totally copy paste I want to say zuku please make your own something. He is not a business he only copies no businessman can admire you;
Doesn't work well. And is boring and dread the features are to much like Twitter. The truth app is better than this app;
Cant post anything because it always says, something went wrong try again later. And its been weeks now.;
"All good now, just need search now...Installing and it errors with ""on boarding failed"" Oh no... Blue check marks ‚ôæÔ∏è";
Tolong diadain fitur buat DM biar bisa chatting;

Absolutely trash. Waste of time!;
AS;
The recent update lists: Two ways to customize your feed üí¨ Translations üëÄ New ways to filter notifications ‚ûï An easy Follow button ‚úÖ ‚ÄúApprove all‚Äù follow requests It's a lie. Not one of those things exist in the app. It is nearly the same as before the update with one positive change: the feed now shows posts that don't include people you follow a well as those you do. Otherwise mine would rarely update.;
Good;
Good;
Just a bad copy of Twitter;

Digital brosis wah kya app hai;
A good app I like & that's give me a hint of improving my content . This app is so expensive in free of cost I like it so much;
Quickly gets boring;
AP jo bhi launch kiya hai bahut achcha;
Nothing to say;
Profoundly boring.;
Best;
A quick way for large accounts to accept tonnes of follow request might be a good update. I'm so tired of scrolling down and approving requests that's been pending before I joined threads. It doesn't even scroll down to that point anymore. üò≠;
Not working at allüëé;
Simple, superficial and not entertaining.;
Good experience;
Don't support freedom of speech;
Collecting too much data;
it's kinda slow, still missing many features, need to save pictures and videos and such..;
Nice üñ§‚ù§Ô∏è;
You need region topics or trending topics to be specific to discussed. Not random people posted.;
copy;
Getting better every week.;
Much better than Elon Twitter (or X or whatever it is now). Have fun paying 8 dollars a month for that weird app that isn't even Twitter anymore.;
Copy and paste.;
Very Good app, an alternative of twitter.;
Pwe!;
Also we need to font sizes, colour and type in this application, To make a unique....;
With only being able to search other users with the search feature, then what's even the point?;
Gud application...By saintmsg;
Fake app;
I like this app but the other app like this is better. Maybe it's still in beta or whatever. When you start scrolling the timeline, the cursor is too sensitive and starts dragging things you don't want to drag. The application named 'threads', unfortunately there is no draft feature here, this will be difficult for me who wants to save threads to upload the next day.;
2023-07J-26th Seems you need an Instagram account to use? Not interested in one, so then can't use Threads.;
Boring üòí;
Awful!! I uninstall this app;
ü§Æü§Æü§Æ;
It's a much more convenient for me than, for example, Twitter. But pay attention please, the view comments not working.;
it's really a great app, but I think it need a message feature;
I like threads;
Better option than X. The developers must introduce upgrades for better UI. An edit button is missing is one. Still great app for people to avoid hatred, bigotry, etc.;
Not loading even after update;
trash;
Twitter is better;
Was a great app to start. I've enjoyed being there far better than twitter. So much less toxic there and via Instagram can block troll/scam accounts + any other accounts they create which then reflects on threads as they're blocked there too. Downsides at the moment is that it is now very glitchy, threads often fail to post & options to see followers threads not available still, despite it NOW being available to everyone else!;
This is a nice app but 1 problem not a dark them option in app;
I have not been aple to start any thread for a long time. I can't see any replies. This makes the app completely useless for me. I hope this gets fixed soon.;
Loved the UI/UX;
So far, Threads is good. I'm waiting for more features like, Threads header and Archive button.;
We love Twitter üòä;
Cheap copy of X;
Very good app üëç;
"Getting there. The newer ""following"" feed is better than a feed full of tat, but it shouldn't be hidden behind an icon click. Needs alternative reactions (not just heart/like) but already feels much better than some well known equivalent apps ...";
Very good experience with this app ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è;
You only see posts from brands and verified influencers. It's pretty pointless just now. Despite millions of users you see the same threads over and over;
Loving the platform. Been great making new contacts and engaging more with existing contacts.;
It shows me content that I'm not interested in!;

So much better than that X-crement app. Unless you're a troll Nazi, of course.;
It's a nice app..fun and interesting...had to change my review,the app has been showing posting for the past. 5days I've been unable to use it;
My experience since day 1 has been great. Developers are responsive.;
Basura, aburridisimo, no hay nada que hacer, es una porquer√≠a ver publicaciones de gente que ni sigues, el dise√±o es plano y no entretiene.;
Still too many bugs Crashes at least 3 times per day;
No dark mode. Give me dark mode and I'll make it a five star.;
Just copy paste from twitter;
Nice and stuff;
Excellent replacement for the ex-social media platform that's abandoned all pretense of protecting users from disinformation. Easy to use. Good design. üëç;
Great app;
Fantastic! Haha Elon! You suck!!;
Brilliant, continues to improve every day, carousel feature is great. Easier on the eye.;
Adding a star because it's improving! ----- So far, it's kind of a mess because you can't view only those you follow. Twitter still has that, so far ... I may not stick with this app if they don't let me curate my own feed.;
Useless app;
search option is only for username. Bad.;
Don't let MAGA fool you, Threads is G-R-E-A-T !!! üëç;
It needs a way to save a thread And it needs a veryyyyy creative music system that you can add music to a attached videos and like instagram amd you can save music from a thread;
Totally usesless app .copycat;
The experience is really just about average, but the fact that you don't just follow your friends makes it a little unique.;
Wasting of time, an copy of others!;
Enjoying this alternative to Twitter. Look forward to its continued growth;
Not bad I think it's good need to work on scrolling sensitivity..and I'm always with new ideas and creativity ‚ô°;
Worst app and copy material;
please update my VIP official;
Is not good, look like Instagram;
Amazing;
Much better now! Glad to see that user requests are being listened to.;
Jai baba ki;
2 weeks of crashes. No crashes when browsing, but constant crashes when trying to add or edit content, etc. Can't add more than one pic at a time or it will crash, etc.;
I dropped Twitter after finding a calm and informative environment on Threads. No trolls or haters, no creeps in my DM. It's a friendly space.;
Mark is the biggest scam. Tweet is the real deal. Elon is the best;
Im a fan of Elon Musk, now you know why I rated 1 üí™üòè;
Please also add not just accounts from instagram, but also from facebook. I deleted my instaüò≠ I need to tweet but twitter has lot of nonsensical rules and gonna be gone soon so this is my only hope haha;
So many bugs;
Love it. I have been looking for a replacement for Twitter for a while, and now I'm sure I finally found one! Still has a few features to add and some minor bugs, which is to be expected from a new app, but it does exactly what it's supposed to do. Don't ever feel the need to go back on Twitter now!;
copyright fringedment maybe;
"The app is in the early stages, but I can see where in time this forum can become useful and fun. I'm already finding most of the people/celebs/groups/companies that I already enjoyed following on other social apps, so while it is a bit quieter I feel when the app moves to a web version and gains ""threading"" threads that people will stay better engaged.";
This app is way better than the original app. Way comforting as well;

Amazing ‚ò∫Ô∏èü§©;
Why do I see threads from random people in my feed...;
Worst app;
No dark mode;
Bad üòû;
Good functionality at initial release. The dev team has already made many positive changes in the first 2 weeks. Looking forward to more great features coming soon!;
The app's just a Twitter (now X) replica.;
Still missing some features like bookmarks, and media tab on your profile. I also prefer the search page on Instagram which shows you some posts from people you might be interested in following. But other than that it's a nice change of pace from twitter;
Boring;
Good;
This app is depressing from the very first day i opened this app about two weeks ago i was welcomed with a restriction pop up from that day till date the restriction warnings keeps poping up each time i try to follow back a follower its so frustrating.;
They claim latest update would allow you to weed out all the other annoying profiles of people you don't know or follow and only show those you do just like Instagram and Twitter BUT THAT'S A LIE!! Still seeing DOZENS of profiles from all kinds of profiles and they're HOURS OLD POSTS!!! ü§¨;
ls this app easy To use ‚ù§Ô∏è;
Feed customization isn't working. I'm still getting my followers and recommended accounts in one feed instead of separated. The UI is fine, works smoothly, but why isn't my feed customized right after I just updated it?;
Nice app, but needs more editing. Please add an inbox where we can share messages without using Instagram.;
For you feed must not be the top option. I have not seen a single person who cared about suggested content. There must be an option to see content you actually follow and another option to set it to be opened by default. All of the suggestions are irrelevant mess.;
Bad;
Please include dark mode feature on threads;
I don't literally get it what this is all about, and for what or why this is needed. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è And is that a bug issue or what, why can't I show my badge number in my instag profile as an icon instead of Link üîó.;
Instagram account delete kar do par Twitter se best to nhi hai yaar yeh;
A good start. Looks beautiful. Just need to get hashtags and a explore page now. The trickiest part, but would make the biggest difference for the app.;
Awesome;
Not Twitter;
Free;
Cool;
Now I used it 10 days. I feel good but i think there is need to a lot of work.chating option is makeing good it.;
That's amazing experience;

Nice;
Threads app is a lite version of Twitter üòè;
Good;
Perfect!;
Vip app;
Horrible lacks everything and content is extremely boring, and you can't delete your threads account without deleting your Instagram one.;
I got some glitches like screen is overlapping, profile is not open;
If you hate free speech and love oppression of ideas, join threads!!!!;
Waste;
Twitter knockoff that doesnt even accomplish anything. Forgot it existed after like 2 days;
Amazing app with an unmatched scope!;
Unless you want to follow big brands, this app is pointless. There's no good way to connect with people with similar interests.;
It has trouble loading comments and even profiles. Had to reinstall but still getting same issues;
Maybe I'm blind but I don't see any translation options with the update?;
At first I was following in love with this app, but last two weeks I cannot see my previous posts and post new ones.;
For Sony Xperia 5 II it always appears a message that says: Sorry, something went wrong. Try again later. I can't see my and the other ones profiles.;
just a copy paste of twitter;
Fabulous app. So many wonderful features. A lot of fun!!;

Usefull this app public Thanks for Instagram üíï;
Well you can't just copy someone elses work. (Read that again) Twitter never worked for me, I don't see Threads working either. It was good at the start giving me the old Facebook statuses vibe or a place where we can just casually thread but now with all the celebs/corporations threading I am going to have to delete this app. I don't want to wake up to thousands of threads from famous people and companies as I don't have the time scrolling through it. Maybe they need another tab for celebs?!?!;
Simply waste;
Good app? Very current....;
Threads, an Instagram good app.;
üôÇüôÇ;
Worst;
it's okay, not worth the hype. like it's giving twitter, it's very similar to twitter, you know? it gets boring and there's nothing special about it. it was overhyped during the app launch and it was never that serious. there's no point of this apps existence, i'm not saying it's a bad app because it's a copy and paste of twitter even though it is, but it's a bad app because it's not needed. like what're we suppose to do with this? honestly i have no idea so let's unlaunch this app real quick.;
This app is so boring it's ridiculous. I hate that it automatically follows all these verified accounts instead of letting us choose who we start following. Yes we can unfollow but the list is so very long now! This is the most intrusive app ever, do not recommend. You can't delete your profile btw, ever.. Without deleting your insta.;
I used this once. Then I changed my password. Now I'm not able to log back in;
Hahaha obly 3.1? Elon wins ig;
Better than twitter Awsome;
Awesome üëç;
Good app hai ji üëçüëçüëç;
Bahut badhiya Bhai;

Garbage. Everywhere says something went wrong. Can't check notification, following, accounts.;
Just love this app‚ù§Ô∏è;
"The ""for you"" vs ""following"" feeds don't show up on Android even after update";
Honestly completely forget about the app;
Worst app I ever installed;
"I can't post, I just get ""your thread failed to upload"" error, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4. Please fix urgently, I'm a social media manager and this is prevents us publishing since there is no we interface.";
We already have Twitter!;

Has much less features compared to Twitter and they are keeping the users as hostages because if you delete the thread account your Instagram account will also get deleted. üòÖ;
New and beautiful experience;
It has potential but lacks features like trending and search by topic function all you can do is search for accounts there's no discover page.;
Still need to grow and improved;
every time I open the app I see posts I don't care to see;
Pls assist I suddenly can't login to threads . It keeps telling me password was changed by the owner and its my thread and linked to my Instagram. Pls what can I do. Thank you;
Very sleek and very boring.;
Es threads an Instagram se ladkiyan reply kregi yaa nahi üòñ;
Kalamsk;
Boring app, exact replica of twitter which really shouldn't be allowed, and missing way more features than twitter, which makes twitter the better option to use still than this app.;
Twitter is better;
"Threads need a ""save post"" option like the original Instagram app.";
Is that app still not doing any harm? I downloaded that one myself, so people say that if you delete that one, Instagram will be deleted, those lies.;
Zukerberg app , Hell No.....;
Elonnn gang;
Very very bad;
Mc jokar insta I'd follow me 25k follow;
Twitter is better. There is no outside updates like news,events etc...Only just to see tweets of the people.Be real man.It is worst to use. Twitter is better;
This a worse clone of Twitter, don't install and don't use;
"Hey! Hope u guys are going well without any stress, you're honestly doing great!

Trending page. Now!;
It's so boring app. We can't do nothing more in this app.;
Good;
Useless app, however 5 stars cuz screw musk;
Since Elon Musk has rebranded Twitter into X, now you should rename Threads into Twitter. That's it. Pay me later for this idea.;
Because what the actual trash is this? I didn't even get a chance to use it and it keeps crashing.;
Useless app;
Twitter better;
maangas;
I cant seem to chat on this app...;
Boring, overall just celebrities all over your feed posting nothing good. App is unstable and very limited. Impossible to make friends on there, you basically need to have had a large Instagram following to import otherwise you just talk to yourself.;
It just became junk.. Just like Twitter, after this last damn update.. unsolicited content now appearing in threads. Started off with just the subscribed feed/related content. Now have to block each damn one. Thought this was gonna be different.. So what next? ads.???Might as well to back to Twitter.;
"A ""lite"" version is a must! This is too bloated for something that looks like Instagram lite.";
Could it be anymore terrible;
Full of bugs, not worth trying to get in touch with meta support;
Super bad app that kept showing post from random people and not what your friend post.;
I wanted to give this zero but the one least rating here.;
Nice... Btw I wish android user can use thisü•∫;
I keep seeing other people's posts i never follow.;
Not that I use it much anyway, but it basically doesn't work. It seems I can make a post, and I can view the main feed - but search, my page and the likes tab all just give an error message ('something went wrong. Try again...'). It was fine for the first 2-3 days, and given that ever since. Not really useable when the majority of tabs don't even work.;
Nice App'S;
1. When someone threads (?) Post with pic we can't download them that's really disappointing 2. If you have created ur thread acc and if you delete it your insta will also be deleted like wtfff;
Sensational App, I hope it stays this way;
Don't even no were to sign up;

When this app is launched Within the 2 hours I have downloaded it, It's amazing and one of most beautiful thing which I likes more is that it can link with Instagram both are good aaps Thanks Mark Zuckerberg üòä;
Gud application and but application name is hard..;
App Zucks;
It's not bad but I don't have a lot of futures and it is just some pics and text that we can share and it makes it boring;
The community is good but lacking many features. There are no trending topics, there's no free text or tag search, no official API yet, and no Web access to Threads either. It has potential in terms of size of userbase and the fact that Meta is behind it, but this is not a finished social network.;
Trash;
Accepting request is difficult task;
Bad Random posts by random people. Lots of garbage inspirational quotes and selfies of random narcissistic vacuous people Why the heck would anyone want to see any of that? It's like Instagram but somehow it's even worse;

This is a bad copy of X (former name Twitter) and this app is very limited and separated you from online world and it's look like local and limited.;
Worked beautifully during the initial rollout, now it no longer works even after the update. Just has a blank screen with constant spooling of logo. Waste of time as I can't uninstall and reinstall as it will delete my Instagram account, too. Very disappointed.;
We hope that these apps will not let us down üôèüòåüòå;

I can't rate it at all because I'm unable to upload posts to my threads these past few days... Over 15 replies and posts are unable to upload to my threads... Please you need to resolve this as I am having a hard time;
Improvement is needed I feel the feed loading is comparatively slower and UI lacks simplicity when compared to X( twitter);

Meta and its affiliates are known to harvest user data and sell them to other companies. As long as the app isn't approved in the EU (strong privacy policy) don't download it or use your Instagram to create an account.;
This app is great. But we need together conversation.;
SamsungGalaxyTabA6 SM-T580;
eh;
Great start!;
There's quite bugs and lagging but it's understandable because it's a work in progress. I will still give it 5 stars because this app looks promising. I just wanna suggest too that since other apps have banners or cover photo. Can we have themes like in messenger? But only in profile tab. The app just looks a bit bland to me, hoping for more design/customization.;
Sort of works. I constantly get an error saying something went wrong. I have cleared data, cleared cache, reinstalled and still the same thing. Can't view replies or notifications.;
Excellent thanks;

ü§çü§ç;
I love it. And it's clean not like twitter where all the hashtags directly linked to ] P**n. Threads is linked to your instagram. It gives you sudden boost of followers and you can communicate with them easily.;
Please make this app great we need it;
Worse than X / Twitter. I never see posts from people I follow and the ui is sub par;
Bad app, Twitter is way better;
Ok while it lasted;
It's bad cause I need to delete the account but there's no option to do this;
Another annoying scammers app Instagram was and is just fine than to add or follow more people in threads. Stick with Instagram not worth the hassle if annoying scammers;

What a ridiculous app! It's literally a copycat of Twitter now X. If you like being censored then sure stay on Meta but I will stick with X as it is far better then anything Meta has to offer.;

stop showing the threads of users i dont follow;

Useless. Keeps refreshing itself while im writing a reply comment. Looks crp too. Update, this app keeps freezing. Is this really supposed to be an alternative to Twitter? Lol;
Not ready to compete twitter;

Another slightly inconvenient thing is that you can't see any of the posts you've liked, or if there is a way to see them, it's not clear at all, I would like to be able to go back and see what posts I've liked.";

Very Very important app;
Was excited at first but after some time I realised its never going to live up to expectations. It's just Instagram but with tweets instead of captions. It doesn't have trending topics and ofcourse, since it's Instagram, it doesn't allow discussion of certain topics or sharing of certain photos or videos. It will never be or come close to Twitter. Do not waste your time.;
Copied;
Time pass h Factory of distraction ü§Øü§Ø;
Let us save pictures;
Large companies likes meta, Google trying to occupy the field by launching their own app just for their own benefit by suppressing small apps;
at this point this app is useless for two reasons: 1. the feed is mixed (it's full of people and accounts I don't know). i suggest they add two columns: following and for you. 2. no hashtags no usable search function.;
Deactivated my account.Its completely pointless.;
There is no messaging features and Not able to save another post.;
Without hashtags its pointless. People want an alternative to twitter.;
App is nice. But the app doesn't have dark mode option. So add the dark mode off for all device.;
I love this app;
It is good but after the update a lot of things are broken again so changing the review to 3 stars üòÆ‚Äçüí®;
"It's a great app just like Twitter (now X). Mark's motto is ""Why work hard when you can just copy and paste üòÅ""";

Don't copy;
Barely works, always getting a lot of errors. The app shows some ref dots for new updates, but the page to see them har need failing for weeks.;

Becareful, your data is important!!!;
If you really wanna beat X you need to give what X don't like able to write very long words.;
It's good;
Exlent ‚ù§Ô∏è;
I see it as an alternative to Instagram and Facebook. Twitter users are different. Instagram and Facebook will suffer for reason only this garbage kind of thread app;
This app is useless , you didn't create anything new here , you just copied ( stole ) twitter and gave it another name üëé;
I just love this app I give a 100%;
A lot of work need to be done, not my job to tell you where to start.;
This app does not support keyword search. As an active Twitter user, the lack of this feature is a showstopper, and the app is next to useless for me. Having the feature currently in the pipeline is understandable, but the fact that Meta decided to hype a beta version just to gain momentum over Twitter is disappointing. Uninstalling this app.;
Absolutely pointless, irrelevant, and dead.;
Fantastic application for expressing our feelings;
Thread is a good app but I don't like the issue of not accepting large amount of followers request at once it's totally tiring to start accepting each of my followers I have 4k followers;
I'm unable to view profiles, my own and others. Also, I can't see comments on threads, just the original post itself. On the whole the people on the platform are extremely positive and uplifting, unlike other platforms.;
It's so much cool;
Facebook bans people for expressing their opinion;

It's like Twitter but worse somehow.;
Pretty good extension;
"Threads is boring. What initially seemed like a perfect solution for all things Twitter, became more of what Instagram already is: 'Captions labelled as threads.' I don't entirely blame the devs here though; people are just not willing to do anything different here. Unless the team brings in some life altering, news centric changes: like trending news stories and popular hashtags, this will likely not hit the spot. Quitting for now, but still on the fence to see what is to come next.";
Ok, so now we need the option to be able to search for content, to able to use hashtags etc. cause all I'm able to do is search for users.;
Racist app;

Can say boo on there. Get warning 3 your out. Newspapers couldn't even post a story and got posts taken down and warned one more time you're out.

It lag(like a broken screen) when i want to type , so I can't pretty much see anything. And if you could how do i know i seeing what i follow/friend post?;
Was great in theory but poor execution. The first day I saw my followers/people I followed. Then it was ALL people I didn't and I never saw anyone I followed unless u went to their profile. Definitely needs fixing. And a separate website. And easier access to be able to switch accounts like Instagram.;
Love it;

I don't think restrictions are good for this app I understand you want to protect your community but if we don't connect with others due to restrictions how are we going to grow.;

"SUCKS!! Keeps 'Failing to Upload'. There's no update. Keeps giving me notifications that about new Followers but every time I look it says ""Sorry, something went wrong,"" App SUCKS!!";

Very nice app;
Like the new following feed view;
PILTANDAS;
Very good and good;
This is literally an Instagram redesign. And it looks awful;
Data security is very bad...... It's leaked all your data information to third party. So be careful. Don't install this application.;
Very bad experience...üòî;
I can't post anything or edit anything at all. I haven't been able to since launch. I'm active US military living overseas and I'm not sure if it's because of my European sim card or VPN or what. I've tried cellular data, wifi, VPN off, VPN on, different VPN locations, clearing cache, clearing data, restarting, reinstalling, everything. I use a Samsung Note 20 Ultra 5G with a Vodafone sim card. I've also tried it on different phones with the same result. Basically unusable.;

"Please Enable The ""Dark Mode"" Option.";
I used it for a couple days. Error started poping up. I cannot use my feed, post anything or interact with anyone.;
Very nice app;
Please add an option to prevent autoplay of videos. (And maybe auto download of images also.) I'm on a mobile data plan that I have to pay by megabytes and that drains my bandwidth.;
Very good üëç;
Bekar hai faltu app hai;
Trash;
Nice;
I downloaded this app in the hopes of replacing X, former Twitter, since I think it might be imploding thanks to Musk. There aren't enough profiles on board. Some that I follow on Twitter are not (yet) on threads. I really don't like that it doesn't have some sort of equal to trending topics or topics to follow.;
Totally awful. It gives me both restrictions. I can't follow or like anyone posts. It‚Äôs been 2 week now. After all it didn‚Äôt told me that how many days are left. I need update 'bout this or am not gonna use it anymore. üòï;
Umfal;
Don't want this copy of twitter made by meta. Using twitter and deleting this app. Why to start again when we are already going good on Twitter.;
It's very good Application for interact for other;
Copied idea from Twitter....create some genuine app;
Copy;
Worst app. Not a good app to use.;
Rubbish. Apart from the publicised issues with following and such, app simply won't work: full feed is present, but not replies, mentions and ability to even post all don't work, rendering the app entirely useless.;
Yas;
Not bad.;
Aap acha to hai per agar ey Instagram se hai To esame reels ka option nahi Ey to hona hi chahiye tha;
ÿπÿßÿØŸä ŸÖÿßŸÅŸäÿ¥ ÿ¨ÿØŸäÿØ;
Copied from Twitter;
Inside the app I'm not having any issues. Except one. And it was this morning that it was pointed out that there was a new translator button only I don't have that button. There was an update 3 days ago which I did do but apparently this update did not take because I have none of the new features that they say they've released. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't fix the problem. Contacted the developer and am waiting. If this isn't fixed I will not be using the app.;
Very nice üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç iiiiiiiiiiiii;
Love the app as a replacement to Twitter.;
so bad;
nice app ‚úåÔ∏èüñ§;
Great;
App literally doesn't work.;
Lo instal√© pq hab√≠an puesto l√≠mite de mensajes en twitter y me fui ah√≠. El for you page no funciona de manera adecuada y l mitad de cosas las censuran, en alg√∫n momento pens√© porque la p√°gina se estaba adecuando pero fue totalmente lo contrario. Es solo una copia de twitter con contenido m√°s limitado no la recomiendo. Su est√©tica puede llegar a ser bonita pero nada que ver con la p√°gina.;
Wonderful idea but lots of bug's app asking again and again you password wrong;
Nice app;
Bogus;
The app is nice. The only thing it lack is the trending page and obviously translation features I follow alot of creator that doesnt speak English and the translation features would really help (Edit. 29 July of 2023) The new update add translation features, At least that's what it says on the playstore. But there isn't any translation feature once the app is open. I'm guessing it is a bug?;
Brilliant app! My new go to for social media;
This is an Amazing app! I like how it performs, it's buttery-smooth and so fast, I wish they add couple of features to the future updates such as a following page, being able to edit Threads and DMs would be great. But overall it's a great social media app and I'm enjoying it so far.;
It sucks;
Never works;
Very good;
Best app ever;

After two weeks, I can no longer follow other accounts. I can still post. I've been in this jail over a week with no response from META or threadsapp. No indication as to what I did wrong. VERY DISSAPOINTING. I was hoping it would replace Twitter...;
Twitter is better than this appüëçüëç;
The app is absolutely ridiculous...;
Amezing application;
My first install was broken & missed UI so I had a profile with no interaction. Reinstallation of threads fixed the UI issue & saved my login. 4/5 I have no friends so cool app. Buggy so I could find exploits.;
The follow/for you tab sometimes disappear and pulling all the way up just refreshing the tab you're on. Swiping to change tab is a bit inconsistent as well. Glad the mute function actually works! Help get rid of uninterested content fast;
This app lasted less than an average men in bed.;
Not üö´ good;
Nice App;
Hi is copi tuwitae;
Copycat;
Fantastic and helpful;
I'd install it if we could make an account without having instagram;
SJW woke posts only. I was censored for saying the Virus was man made in China.;
Aabb;
"Threads app shows promise as a daily diary platform with its Twitter-like interface. However, it would benefit from a ""Filter by Date, Month, and Year"" option to enhance the user experience.";
This is a waste app;
Worst app ever, even a simple RTL text not rendered correctly;
Even though I have an extra 60 gb free on my phone this app is still a waste of memory. Nothing useful or interesting, stay away from this app;
Hoping it kills off the blue bird, but it's still buggy af.;
Prefect app;
This app is rubbish and will never be a worthwhile backup for established apps like instgram or even Facebook so just don't bother with it;
Currently pretty mid won't lie but once those are introduced I will be a great successor to what twitter once was and will likely never be again thanks to nelo skum;
Bad;
Kinda boring;
It is literally a knock off of Twitter Sued how you like that;
What is this ??? I want to meet hoodlum. I think he's my baby father.;
Twitter better I give this app 1/10;
Great app;
The worst app I've ever used . If I delete Threads it deleted my Instagram account. Tbh it doesn't even deserve the one star i gave . Hate this app a lot .;
Ver bad app. No new ideas. A lot of bugs;
App for all;
It a ok app;
A+++;
Amazing App;
Cheap knockoff;

It's a good start but we need better ways to search topics & find feeds we want.;

Blocked by no reason And army of bugs there;
Well well well;
For god's sake let us filter the timeline to only people we follow. I follow people because I care about what they post and I can't even see any of it without going to their profile. It's like scrolling through adware for popular accounts to find my friends.;
Best;

This is a worst app I have ever seen my life. Don't know how to solve we restricted certain activity to protect our community. I reported several time to solve this problem, but still it occurs.;

Shitlongated Muskrat getting into Twitter was a mistake.;
Way too many permissions required to use this, also X is better.;
It's just a begging...;
At first it was operating smoothly but after a week, I couldn't see my notifications nor those who followed my account. I logged out,then I signed in again. It persisted. I uninstalled it and downloaded again,still the same issue. Then I tried to clear the cookies and cache and it still glitches...;
Pathetic app, Totally a copy of Twitter X, Bad app, Elon Musk Jindabad.;
This apk can't replace Twitter;
Cery nice;
I was keen to give this app a go but I don't have Instagram, so I can't even make an account.;
Sucks;
you guys need to really update the translation option here!! do it asap !;
The worse and fake Twitter. Don't put it in the Play Store if the users can't even post or normally use it! All my posts crash, even those I posted days before. Go away, fake Twitter.;
Very nice platform but video uploading very slow please solve this issue;

It's the best app I have ever seen;
Doesn't work for me. I want to look for eg news topics which I can do on twitter but the search only gives me people with that word in their profile name. Maybe there is a way to do it but I havent stumbled across a profile that discusses the topic.;
Faltu aap....;
Pretty bare-bones. But at least the guy running the joint isn't knocking up the help.;

I like this app;
Disgusting amounts of data collected, INCLUDING PICTURES OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT!! This app takes photos and recordings without your knowledge. It's not even approved for use in EU yet due to their predatory data collection. This is disgusting, screw this app.;
Everybody post pictures here;
Give us option to download images on Android and put the like button on the right side;
I hope there's a pinned thread too.;
Love it so much;
No privacy. Just want people to spend their valuable time on social media;

pls add dark mode;

This app needs a trending page! As soon as it does, goodbye rivals;
I'm just gonna stick with Twitter for now as this app collects so much privacy data which I'm just not comfortable with that.;
Thank you..at least we wont miss twitter because we have something better now .;
It's not working. In the beginning, I was enjoying this app, but suddenly, it stopped working properly. Now I can't post nor see my previous threads. Can't search or see my friends' posts. The only function left is the feed. Reported these errors, but nothing has changed. So exhausting;
Nice futures;
Silly;
It's not equal for Twitter.. Also;
App is just a ripoff of twitter and nothing poor app;
We would've been thrilled to have the option of translating on threads‚ò∫Ô∏è;
We don't need it;
They tried to copy twitter, but failed at even that. Quite pathetic to say the least;
Copy;
TWITTER is BETTER than this junk.;
Endless stitching;
Esta app tiene futuro, mientras sigan trabajando en ella;
It's still not good, it just contains random famous people;

Not available for Windows, which is where I spend most of my time.;
Almost as bad as tik tok on the private data collection, guess they're getting ready for the next 'election' üòÇ;

Not good enough you need to work more;
Delete it;
Very very good;

Great concept. Notifications not refreshing. Updated : no help from support. Not refreshing, not posting, nothing. I'll give it another week before I delete it.;
Not recommended!;
It would be nice to be able to switch accounts!;
Restriction is too much on the app. You cannot follow, cannot like everytime we restristrict certain activity to protect our community. This totally disgusting.;
Still cant filter by following. Im updated, uninstalled, reinstalled, everything but when i tap the Threads icon i dont get the option and am stuck on For You. Last ditch before im back to X -- help me out here Zuckernerd;
You have to have an instagram account? I don't want to do a whole other thing I just want to make one account for the thing I want. Is it possible to make a Threads account?;

Un useful;
The app logged me out and won't let me log back in;
will not let me sign in on computer;
Love the community.;
I am enjoying the service well enough but it's missing a very important feature. There is no way to search for a specific topic you're interested in. It's hard to find conversations to join if you can only see what's going on in your timeline. Joining live conversations via social media is one of the most popular features of a service of this kind.;
Stupid copy if instagram lol, nothing interesting!;
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!;
Nice app;
Came out of the gate running. Looking forward to what this becomes.;
Was starting to hate twitter thankgod now we have thread.;
Collects too much personal info;
Very Bad;

Too many account po-up in my feed that not suit for me;

When I deleted the app my Instagram account is gone;
"Way worse of a setup than ""X""";
It wasn't that good;
Not able to compete with Twitter sorry Mera guys;
Garbage;
Bad app;
I like Threads, but I'd like to see both more options for searching for topics, as well as a webpage/desktop version.;

"Pretty boring to be honest,I think people only download this app to get the ‚Äúaccount number."" it's an interesting feature but not worth the hype.The app seems to be full of boomers. although it is directly connected to Instagram and Facebook and has a load ton of my data, the fyp is still trash . Although I like that there is no ad, I think it's the only useful feature and just a copy paste of twitter. In short it's not better than Twitter and is not worth the hype.";

Threads is a lot better now, but we still are very much in need of some way to create topics on Threads via hashtags or some equivalent. If I want to look up posts concerning a topic, I can't really do that right now without finding a person's account first.;

Here's some feedback.......could I double tap to like posts and have the entire rethread, comment, and share/send on the right of the posts.....it's alil janky to move all the way to the left of the screen with your thumb to like a post. liking posts and having the comment option easier to reach will make scrolling threads alil bit more fun imo.;
"Loved it but after a couple of days I get a message of ""Something went wrong. Try again"" on my profile and notifications tab so I cant see or do anything anymore since. My internet is perfect, tried clearing cache and reinstalling, etc but nothing works. Probably a glitch. Its also missing important features but they can add them on the way.";
Read the privacy policy. It collects your phone calls and records them, text messages, political statuses, emails and logs them, collects your videos, pictures, your location, hone addresses and CREDIT SCORE... STAY AWAY;
Totally garbage;
This app lacks features. It's just an abyss;
Do not copy any app;
Discussing;
I can see the posts and that's it. Error for: my own threads, opening threads, liking or seeing the likes, etc. You had a perfectly good design to beat X, and you ruined it.;
Copy paste üåö;
It's the same as Instagram, showing me the vulgar, cringe content that I never subscribed to. At this point, Meta has no idea what they're doing. They can just copy others and the whole Meta ecosystem is shallow and absolutely contributes to triggering my mental health with all the bottom of the gutter goo that they shove up my face. Hope Meta goes bankrupt and the world moves on to better things.;

The algorithm is very inaccurate and too random as an artist I don't find dis app useful to grow a community since the algorithm is not to specified people's likings it's recommending my illustration to wrong audiences. I hope u can change dis algorithm cause is too out of hand, I gave it one week uploaded two illustration daily basis and barely got any likes. I even tried scrolling down to see recommendation and when I did there were no consistency on the same theme recommendations were random.;
More if the sane abd harder to use... basically not thought out;
You need to give Instagram your information 1st, not a individual app.;
Superb but useless app;
copy paste X;
they just disabled my account without warning thats why my ig main account is still disabled. Its been 3weeks and still no action? Pls fix it. I regretted i made an account in threads.;
Aplikasi nya bagus hanya saja kurang inovasi coba kalau bisa buat fitur seperti aplikasi path dulu;
Okay just logged into threads after like a week away. New tab called following appears. My heart quickens, clicks, screams in joy as I see what I have been waiting for. Okay good bye twitter/ X.;
I was a Twitter follower and since the ownership change it changed (for the worst). Threads came along and we love it. I would love to see and use it on my computer. Using a keyboard and a larger screen would be nice.;
Ew;
What i hate about this app that my wall is always fielded by posts by the people that i dont follow. And meta doesn't seem to care to use algorhythm to do that;

The thread app is a valuable tool for concurrent programming, enabling efficient multitasking within a single process. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage threads, enhancing performance on multi-core processors. However, users must exercise caution in handling synchronization to prevent race conditions and deadlocks. Proper understanding of multi-threading concepts is essential for maximizing the app's potential. Overall, the thread app offers great utility for developers, but care a;

Threads app, billed as a rival to Twitter, falls flat on multiple levels. It pales in comparison to the features and user experience offered by its competitor. The app fails to deliver engaging content, lacks a thriving community, and feels like a cheap imitation. Stick with Twitter for a truly fulfilling social media experience.;
So boring app ever;
I was extatic to use it, but recently got an error on my profile page which doesn't go away even if Threads are reinstalled. Reported the problem, but nothing happened since. Sad to delete the app;

If you're gonna be a copycat twitter, copy the good parts of it. No hashtags, one page where 95% of the accounts are ones I don't follow & have no interest in following (doing a lot of muting & blocking), and like Instagram I can't keep a photo zoomed in.

Wow. Technologically and functionally it is clear that it is behind Twitter. The part that really shocked me was the level of pure hatred and single mindedness of focus... immediately it was like anti Trump f'bombs... and I kept scrolling looking for normal discussion on other topics.. but it just keeps going and going. At the end of the day this is just a political app it appears. Sad use of Facebook technology honestly. AND it Ned's moderation. Twitter is bad. This is more bad. :(;
I thought I was gonna get hooked. But... Just not as much fun as I thought it would be. Almost felt like google hangout back in the day (if anyone remembers that).;

This app is a pure copy of Twitter. But the algorithm of promoting new user is worst and no sense. I'm trying to grow since 2-3 weeks but this app is not working properly.;
horrible;
if worst had a face üòÇüòÇ;
In the search tab, why can't you search for a topic? Why can you only search users? When I use twitter, 99% of the time I search for topics, not othe users.;
it's a good apps & easy to use, but need message & story options;
Make a lite version please!;
so bad i don't recommend you downloading this app;
Super üíû;
It's is not like Twitter. It actually seems good by features but it is just a cheap and fail copy of Twitter, now know as X.;
Very bad app. Less features;

User should be able to delete Threads account separately (without deleting original Instagram account);
They called it Twitter's rival but I really don't think so it's a Twitter's rival.;
There are only brands here, no real people ‚ò†Ô∏è;
The app is really slow comparing it to Instagram and twitter;
For an app that's trying to replace Twitter it sure sucks at copying twitter;
Control c. Control v=threds;
You must be on Instagram. I will never do such.;
After downloading this app, I realized that I do not need it at all.;

I am humble to bring the words of God to each one; where ever you are in jesus name. Amen FROM ARUBA ISLAND.
Don't copy. Be unique.;
I'm enjoying Threads. As more and more journalists and interesting people join, I look forward to new features appearing, which will cement its place as a go to app.;
No me gusta, pens√© que ser√≠a como twitter pero es s√≥lo una extensi√≥n molesta y simplona de instagram, de paso que no trabaja bien la app. Zzzzzzzzzzz;
The app crashes when I try to open from this morning.;
It's like a house without furniture!;
It is o.k. similar to Twitter but for some reason I done three unintstalls and installs and have not gotten the updated features as advertised. So not that exciting for me.;
Boring;
The best and pictures and videos plus content is good;
What a terrible app it's not even functional and there's so many errors I will never install this ever again in the underwater area and that I would have gave you 0 Stars if I really could this is literally a wannabe Reddit and also the app keeps on closing out and I read through all your privacy policies it's ten times worse than Instagram do better;
Plain and boring - whats the point besides data collection and showing ads? There's no dark mode. This app doesn't seem to offer anything new.;
Ugh;
So boring;
The app does not offer anything new.;
Bad just wasting time;
üëåüèº;
Just a copy paste of Twitter X. No use for this app. .no real issues will be discussed on this app. Only nonsense;

This app post is nice. This doesn't have a hashtag, poll, and edit.;
Why tp delete Instagram account for thread;
App don't turn with tablet or phone. Why? Missing feature of app...;
Suddenly when launched it minimizes itself and a pop up error says it keeps closing.;
Please put a dark mode option in the settings. Too bright for me.;
It *looks* good but that's where it stops. It works but most basic settings that you should be able to change in app, you have to change in Instagram which is not very user friendly. Honestly this app could've used an extra week or two in development before it launched.;
Not useful;

"Better than my X. But... please change the logo from black and white - it's very hard to spot, looks too much like a lot of apps I don't look at very often. I suggest using the black background and coloured Instagram transition on the ""thread"", the same way the logo is on the apps startup screen. Then it'll stand out more amongst other apps. The whole meta branding could do with an overhaul to show their connections to one another, tbh.";
Decent, but needs work. I particularly don't like that I see all these accounts I don't follow. Seems pointless to follow anyone if you're going to see the entire world whether you want to or not.;

It feels like you've shot your load too early, trying to capitalise on the Twitter situation. Lots of work needed. My timeline is pretty empty. Shame.;
NICE APP;
You should let us give the liberty to keep Threads app or not. I want to delete my Threads account out of privacy reasons, but you guys have made us to choose to delete Instagram too which is in sync with Threads. So uncool service from Meta! I dont want to see contents from people who I dont follow, but its annoying to see things like these in my feed.;

I can't even use the app unless I have an Instagram. It's cool you could transfer everything over from it but how's this more acceptable than Twitter? I can't just sine up. Also meta owns it all so why not also connect it threw fb as well? So my problem is I jut can't flat out use the app. Witch if you want to grow the platform why put up a weird gate block.;
Good..!!;
All posts and texts are overlapping on each other.;
twitter 2.0;
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE;
Barely functional. Search is pathetic. Being able to follow actual threads is not simple. It's just a cynical attempt to capture the twitter disillusioned.;
Ok;
If you want to go back to the 2010 then install this app. Old-school and boring;
A Class....;
üëçüëç;
Mediocre at best. It's impossible to get exposure for your profile without spam liking comments or following people. And for the love of God, will you please allow the use of hashtags?;
It's a copycat app that offers nothing new, nothing different. It's also unethical to be using a stolen app. Uninstalled.;

New usage;
What is the actual point of this app? I've had no major issues using it,but I just don't 'get' it. It's pretty much twitter (sorry, X) minus a billionaire owner. I'm sure there's a long term plan in place to make this relevant. I'll keep it installed for now in the hope it does eventually find it's own identity.;

The worst thing you can do is try it. When I subscribed, it was nice, but after that, it's not important, and why can't I cancel my account other than when I cancel my Instagram account, it's much better. This is my opinion.;

Need to improve the search feature. Cant find relevant threads. Just a bunch of accounts.;
Worst App.. No Views On Post.. Even Post Dont Reach on Follower's Timeline.. Wastage of time.. nothing is useful or entertaining..;
Allow to create account even if do not have Instagram account.;
Whats do you thank?;
BKbaas app;
Like this App;
I don't have a problem with this app. It's still growing and it's still a good app in my opinion. I believe that major things will happen once they keep developing. Just need to be patient and wait and see...;
So far I like. Needs a lil more juice though.;
I literally can't use the app. It won't let me search, post, or look at the notifications. All I can do is scroll on the feed until it stops and buffers. I have tried force stopping, uninstalling and reinstalling, and going online to find solutions. Can't do anything now but sometimes scroll through the feed before it locks or freezes. Thanks Meta üëçüèª;

Too basic no save photo feature no way to search tops at all . The interfaces is ugly and barely functional big flop . If I could put 0 stars I would .;
Threads;
It is promising....my money is on Zuck;
Threads will replace X soon;
Very Good;
Esta aplicacion esta muy lenta al subir mis publicaciones y como hace parte de instagram que siempre tiene fallos al actualizarse perderan un usuario de esta aplicacion tambien;

P√©ssimo!;
"It's literally a twitter clone... only, it's a safe space for easily offended vegan rich left wing kids. It was supposed to be the ""twitter killer"" but tanked so epically, like the failed Facebook satellite... exploded shortly after lift-off haha! Useless app riddled in censorship.";

You can only sign up through your Instagram account, and you have to delete your Instagram account if you no longer want Threads. Too abusive. And the timeline is full of influencers, paid I presumed. I chose to lose my Instagram account rather than keep this app.;

Disgusting. Twitter is a lot better.;
probably the worst app currently existing in the world. needs a ton of improvement. While scrolling, if a text is slightly touched, it remains with copy icon and stays same even after several times scrolling, very annoying with a copy icon. Please add a save to phone option for the photos because after touching the photo, no option is there, looks very basic. AI suggestions for the post are worse than any other apps.;

Really wanted to like this app but when you can't upload anything after clearing data and installing a fresh new install it really takes away from it. FIX THIS. You want people to move from Twitter to this and it's not even functional;

It's Instagram's Twitter. Haven't used it much, but a big gripe for me is you have to manually log out to switch between accounts, unlike the app's sister or basis. It's pretty annoying.;

THREADS IS DEAD. ZUCKTHECUCK Deserves the absolute worst karma possible, he and his. People finding out the hard way why monopolies are bad for the world.;
Was excited to see a Twitter alternative but I'm not able to get in. Instagram demands that I upload a photo of my face and my hand like a 1970s kidnap victim to prove that I'm alive and I refuse to do that. Already gave you my phone number, which BTW is also none of your business. I have been on FB without issues for 15 years. Until you stop with this selfie nonsense on Instagram and Threads I'll stay out.;
I love it;
Twitter is best;

Sorry, something went wrong. Try again.;
Awsome;
GoodüòÉüëç;
Just a bad version of Twitter.;
Nyc interface same like a Twitter but its better than Twitter.;
Threads is thread bare when it comes to having the same key funcations as Twitter (X). Having no way to seach for key works makes finding profiles of random users a pain. Not being able to view your likes is also a pain. I will give credit that it now shows people you're following in a different tab. I still feel like there is a long way to go before the application is ready for the primetime.;
I love it;
Terrible;
The point of this app is to do what? Will reinstall when I find out.;
Decent app. Going to take a bit to get going.;
looking forward to a PC-usable version, rather than just phone/tablet/Chromebook;
Thee best;
Not quite the Twitter replacement it could be just yet, a lot of basic features are missing on top of being tied to Instagram and owned by Meta. But it's already a lot less toxic than Twitter.;
Best fiture in insta;
This app sucks. I got bent over and spanked by Daddy Elon for telling somebody to kys, so now I can't tweet for a week. I thought I'd give Threads a try, and I used it for less than five minutes before deleting it. I guess I'll just have to talk to people in real life instead...;
Bad app;
Thank you for your amazing services!;
Need more options like hashtag supports .;
Worst;
Signup doesn't work;
Jujice;
Hhh;
Get in here;
Difficult in refreshing the page for new post. The following and followers too aint clear, a twitter/ X following & followers model wouldn't be bad. Overall am totally disappointed in this app. Not a good app.;
No images, video download option. Can't zoom pictures it automatically zooms out.;
So boring.... Nothing to do here. If i have to rate it out of 10.... Then if possible... I will give it zero.;
Jvi;

I want to like this app. I refuse to use Twitter, and I was desperate for an alternative. I keep hearing about the following tab but have yet to see that update on my phone.;
I like it.;
Not support desktop user. Super trash;
sorry mark, tapi menurut gue the winner is twitter üëåüèª;
It's fine but app crashes sometimes;
Worst app don't downloade;
Mast app;
It wouldn't be hard to surpass Twitter imo. Just the simple features and none of the nonsense. DM's, quote tweets, trending page, likes tab, media tab. Need these;
I was pleasantly surprised, the feed is very basic and minimalist but in a way I prefer, you don't constantly get bombarded with advertisements. Obviously there's still a few teething issues but overall it performs well enough.;

Twitter for life Edit(X for life);
I use this app regularly, but I do think that if the creators want to keep this app alive, you have to implement some new features that other basic social media apps already have. Like saving/bookmarking, having an explore page where it's not just rando's accounts showing up on ur timeline (it's always posts I don't care about popping up on here like old Facebook memes or religious quotes). A #tag feature wouldn't hurt either. Also the video format here sucks (+ let me zoom in on photos).;
Stupid attempt to copy Twitter;
Just another online space for the dumb, easily manipulated masses. Zero free speech and tailored feeds to continue the relentless brainwashing of the feeble minded.;
Left-wing ranting. Mind you, the alternative is right-wing ranting so it really comes down to what flavour of rage you're into.;
Very lag very bad. In short copy of twitter;

It's a good app and i like it but this app not have a messenger. In my opinion what if there is messenger i think everyone will go for it otherwise the Threads is amazing.;

Not ready yet? Overall feels like a cheap clone of Twitter. The app is incredibly lagy, and the community isn't as strong as on other platforms. I would try it again at a later time, which timings would have been smoothed out.;
No use for this app;
It's good;
The best social app;
Trash version of Elon's x known as Twitter. I'd delete my account, but I think they forced me to link it to insta otherwise it would be gone. Plus this app doesn't promote free speech for everyone. Forced me to look at content I wasn't following. Just don't get this app. Stick to instagram, fb, or x/twitter.;
Easy app üëç;
I think the app is great but if you made it video only but with the same interface as Instagram and the videos be 6 seconds long it would be great cuz it would be like vine 2.0;
Yeah. Musk bought Twitter in billions and you cheated to creat this. You must be ashamed.;

Baaaad;
I get how the vibes when it's first came out, but slowly it's just another platform for Insagram user to post. nothing special, and no new features, nor even the innovations. just plain old social media that mostly text-posting with less features than it's rival.;
Andrew Tate said it is a gay app that's why I am giving it a one star;
As soon as they add direct messaging to the app, it'll be the #1 social media platform I use. Really enjoying the quick updates, adding features pretty much every week. It's been nice actually talking to people again.;
So there been improvements, still lacking hashtags, trends, proper search feature & a better way to refresh timeline. I hope the api allows weather & the like to update people.;
Guys i wish the thread order would add newest replys to the bottom. im using reply to my own thread to expand on content (but it adds the last reply to the top automatically) and it doesnt make sense to read... Or allow users to slide replies up and down and arrange to our liking. Thank you;

I'm glad to hear that Threads, the Instagram app, has received positive reviews in 2023. It seems like the app's updates and features are resonating well with users. If you have any specific questions or topics you'd like to discuss about Threads, feel free to let me know!;

Essential features like customizable notifications and search are surprisingly absent, while the lack of responsive customer support leaves users stranded. A disappointing experience overall.;

Several opportunities with this. 1... Must be an Instagram user... Really? While I am, that's the worst aspect of this app right from the beginning. Any app that forces the use of another is terrible. 2. Search function is the absolute worst. No way to find things you truly wish to other than find things similar and then proceed from there. 3... Give it one week and you'll discover this is a very poorly executed idea. The only app this competes with is MySpace or Xanga, certainly nothing now.;

This app is a complete disaster! No privacy, zero control, and an unstable mess. Zuckerberg's blatant disregard for user privacy is appalling. The app collects and exploits personal data without shame. It's a hacker's paradise. The tyrannical controlled environment stifles freedom of expression. Dissenting opinions are crushed. The app is an alpha-like mess, lacking essential functions and stability. Avoid this privacy nightmare! Zuckerberg should be ashamed.;
Please update the algos of the app. It looks boring and very black interface.. Use colours cause it is boring;
tati;
I like the app, but just a few days after launch, the app changed for the worst. Now you only see famous people thread instead of regular people. The app lacks a lot of things that Twitter has/had. It does have potential but not for me.;
There's nothing special about it to say it's better than Twitter. Not yet at least;
The worst Social Network in the History of Humanity. NOBODY sees your threads! Plus it doesn't even have #. So NOBODY likes you or comment. In other words, ZERO display of your posts. WORST than Twitter!üôÑü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è That could MARK your difference! Increasing the visualisation of our posts. To gain more interactivity and likes and comments!;
Nothing but a cheap copy of Twitter.;
I'm experiencing a bit of problems with this app, as it is not user friendly. In addition it has a huge privacy issues, that the app is stressing about the usage of personal information to third-parties.;
Too many nonsense peoples posting nonsense content;
It has really great potential. But they still don't have the feed chronological? It only seems to highlight celebrities and influencer posts. Leaving most regular folk with bare minimum engagement. Which just feeds a narcissistic culture. Kinda disappointing.;
Oküëç;
App seems good, but it still doesn't allow to customize the timeline. I'd like to have a way to see only content from people I follow.;
Boring and unremarkable app;

Not that great.....Mark should not launch this kind of app out of jealousy..;

Copy of Twitter, smooth feel but old idea.;
Nice;
Wow not great copy of Twitter ü§£ü§£;
Love this;
Passable, but very low on features with nothing new or innovative for this kind of app. It's like a Wish version of Twitter with nothing new brought to the table. Even the name is derivative.;
Amazing app better than Twitter;

One of the greatest app in the world;
Some comments don't show a bad app;
Hacked, with a constant circle trying to report issue, absolutely horrible no customer support no way to contact and correct;
Bad, another fake app.;
Bad app , you can't massage people;
Biggest disappointment of the year. Functionality at release is limited and not intuitively designed at all. Basically useless for socials and just a big business feed.;
I think there must be an option of delete account in this appüôÇ;
off-brand X;

Finally, a new and looks like a more relliable messaging app;

Been using it for some time and there is still too much random, and the search function is more or less trash, cause it only searches for people and not content. The algorithm also sucks.;
Nice;
Lixo de aplicativo;
An awful experience when using this app is that you can't choose to see threads only from the people you care about. I don't like seeing my feed full of stuff I don't care about.;

When I open the app I see a thread I posted days ago or longer which always pops up. I have to click past this before I can read new posts.;
Worst u.i.;
you've been logged out of %1$s. the account owner may have changed the password,, can u repair this problem ?;
I don't like the limitations in the number of words! Please make that longer;
Yes I do like this app but hope not the bad Russia not playing about my thing;

I love this app. It's splendid.;
Its good;
I love bus viral kar do Bhai;
I did not like the sound on on every post;
not worth to be checked;
Most of the time, the app only shows threads from people I don't even follow and have no interest in. When I scroll to the top to view threads from only the people I follow, the option isn't there. It's super annoying and I usually close the app in under a minute. üëã;
Develop it;
Stolen app.;
excellent, despite of few bugs but it's understandable since this is just new. i suggest to add a public reach numbers/views in every post. btw, please fix every bugs asap;

Bad experience;
This app is for me and I have a great time;
Seems OK usage wise.;
Worked fine for a couple of weeks then stopped displaying anything other than the feed, can't look at people's accounts, my own or anything other than the main feed. Shame, was keen to replace X, but looks like I will be stuck with it still....;
The design of the app is not good and the experience not like Twitter,;
Had to uninstall because I wasn't even able to log in again due to an error that didn't go away for weeks now;
I love you üòç;
Honestly I donwloaded the app and used for around a week or two and suddenly got my Instagram hacked. Someone changed my password so I instantly was able to change my password and log it out of any existent device. I blame Threads because of its security, because it's connected to Instagram and because we've been hearing about how our date is collected by it, opening space for actually hackers to possibly do the same, so I uninstalled. Side note, it is illigal in the EU so it must have a reason.;
Just copy past app;
Too much bad.;
Nothing interesting;
I installed this app and immediately my Instagram account was hacked,, this app is whack and should be sued for lack of data protection;
Useless;
What is the actual use of this app, the app is meaning lessü§∑ it just a consume your your time and internet data, I don't like the app;

Whoever made Instagram I used to love that app and now you ruined it for me thanks a lot now I can't not even talk to my friends thanks to you and I didn't mean it possibly on that post it was a joke like playing my account back so I can talk to my friends please and thank you if you be kindly to please and thank you;
App is designed to suit influencers mainly rather than the larger number of users;
"No ""following"" feed.";
Can't even search for a subject;
Bad app, is not useful;
It always glitches. You will open it for the first time in hours and the screen is stuck on a bunch of posts trying to post. Even though you posted them hours ago. The most annoying thing on an app ever! Do better threads. Because you're not coming even close to Twitter /X. Also you can't post any links. How are we supposed to share current events when you can't post links??? Also you can't # anything.. so dumb. Definitely needs so much work.;
Nada contra.;
gud;
Butf and nice üëåüëå;
Never been this wanted to delete threads. Pls don't put it on Instagram.;
This app is embarrassing;
Good one but lame;
Needs to have separate feeds for followed and general news, and trending!;
Just boring as hell and missing a ton of quality of life features. Not impressed;
Following tabs is definitely an improvement but still there is no general search for posts which forces you to only see main tab;
Not as good as X this is awful;
Nice üòÑ app Instagramüëª;
Fantastic;
Love you too my group and Bhai jaan üòò;
Honestly, this app is a lot better than Twitter. I love that it has no tweet counts and word counts unlike Twitter.;
Nul;
this is a poor mans twitter - zucks sucks;
Cool;
Very nice Application, Everything is fine and good.;
The app is good. All is ok. But the policy that ' deleting the threads account will close your instagram as well ' is like threatening your customers to stay on this app. Mark zuckerberg should that this marketing startegy will not work for sure. And please separate it from instagram. Like every new people who doesnt have an instagram will have to create an account. Thats a very big downfall for this app. Else the app is good. Plus not replying to the reviews is also a big downfall;
There's still a lot of improvement needed, like hashtags, switching accounts easily, etc. But apart from that I'm really enjoying it.;
Lame, the app is actually very well designed imo but there's just nothing there;

I haven't really tried out this social platform app yet but It looks like a rip off of the actual Instagram app. other than the looks itself I give it a 4 star.;
It's a twitter coupie;
I know this app is in its early stages but still it's really vexing how it's showing me irrelevant posts from irrelevant accounts more than posts from accounts that I follow.;
If we delete the app our Instagram account will be deleted or.not;

*WARNING FOR INSTAGRAM USERS* If you make an account on threads you will not be able to delete it unless you also delete your instagram account. I am also completely unable to 'deactivate' my threads account even temporarily. + there is an large irremovable badge on my instagram account that advertises my unwanted threads account Do not create a threads account... it is permanent;
Twitter better lmao;
This app is what Twitter should be. Everything about Threads is better than Twitter in every way possible. Also, it's not ran by a nazi.;
Trades failed because it is a separate app and hard to access quickly, and there is no multi-account;
If there is no freedom of expression, this application is useless;
Poor;
Not the Twitter replacement I hoped for. Algorithm is garbage and barely anyone I followed on Twitter has taken up use of Threads, at least not on the timeline I'm shown. I also hate the idea of using a Zuckerberg product;

Posting new contents are very tedious and tiresome. The time it is taking to load and upload a new content is too much. I understand you've implemented it in a way to keep things decentralised, but kindly check if the upload of new contents can be made a bit more faster.;

Okay, the only thing that I liked about this app now you removed it, I didn't allow people to zoom other profile pic's, and now you allow anyone to zoom the profile pic. The app looks so promessing, it's actually beating Twitter, but to finish it, it need to add the edit button for free, and try to hide the followers and following list without making the whole account private, also we need the #HASHTAGS. That's all for now, Keep up the good work;

This has got to be the most annoying threads ever! No choice is given, based on the assumption you want this thread. Constantly coercing you to join threads by displaying thread numbers on your profile, deceptively making others think you are on threads! Whilst you are not! So devious! I refuse to download the app! You can't even opt out! No delete! No cancellation. There are no options. So no download!;

Underwhelming with a lack of draw to come back to the app. Threads feels unfinished and over a month later, there has hardly been any further updates. Poor execution.;

Was working fine for like the first two days after launch. Then my likes, my profile, any comments just refused to load and just said try again. Have uninstalled it and installed it again every now and then till this day and its still same problem. Raised a ticket to dev, dont think it was followed up at all.;
Twitter (X) Is a lot better and has more satisfying ui and use then threads to be honest;
Best app;
It's fine;
Now that updates have happened I up my review to 5 stars;
Twitter knock-off;
We should be able to delete out threads accounts without having to delete our Indtagram accounts in the process.;

Not bad;
I wish I would have never downloaded this;
Good;
Interesting app, but I bummed that I need to create an Instagram account to be able to use it, I would add the fifth star if that changes.;
Very nice;
Not good;
It doesn't even deserve one star. So annoying you can't even delete your account after opening it. And the number of when you joined threads always pops up on you ig account so annoying. I don't see any use of this app;
Can join;

Knock knock knock, are you alive?;

This app doesn't turn with my tablet or phone, why? Where is update?;

Terrible app. Full of woke people that don't want to be able to share ideas unless it's their own. Don't bother unless you're part of that mob.;
I can't even scroll normally or share posts but it has good contents;
Very good app;
Suck algorithm.;
"It all started well but I now have a problem that I can't post or reply to threads (only react with ""likes"") nor even see comments underneath someone's initial thread. I've deleted the cache, reinstalled the app, checked server, checked WiFi speed, no VPN... It's a problem with the app. Please fix it.";
Nice apps;
Thip app was interested because some news are pending;
Threads,an Instagram..;

the algoritm just work for users who's got a lot of followers in IG so they get more followers in here. the app needs hashtag too;

Half baked, under-designed. This is what happens when you release an app to a huge audience with no basic functionality.;
Good üëçüòä;
Best among all;
Nice to meet you app;
This apps needs more time to be as big as IG and it is clearly not for a while;
I love this app everything is good and is just like twitter no videos if you want to watch you search there should be a place to watch videos like Facebook Instagram and the rest thread lite is coming soon anyways thanks to mark Zuckerberg battling with Elon musk;
Just another twitter, nothing much;
Baler app;
They had a following and for you tab that I never seen again after using it 2x;

This is my fav app;
Definitely a fun experience so far. I'd give it a 4 for now since it still needs some essential features. Hopefully, new features roll out faster.;
No usecase;
Only usable if you're one of those stupid woke leftist socialist nazis. If you're Christian and sane then don't bother.;
Good;
Frustrating tablet UI;
I can't download it;
Worst app ever launched;
The app is awesome;
As best for us;
Complete waste of time;
Nowhere near as polished/refined as Twitter (X). Doesn't offer the same experience. I used it for a week and uninstalled.;
Very immature product. Not worth switching to as of August '23 in my opinion.;
Lol, maybe try better when you copy another app next time, lol;
Bad;
Twitter is better threads is cheap copy of it üòÇüòÇ;
A few suggestions: 1. Dark mode option. Please. 2. Easy switch between accounts instead of required to log out first. 3. Can change username even if linked to Instagram.;
Really good app. Would have earned five stars if they had a messaging feature like in Instagram;
you better make this app better than Twitter or X cause I'm sick of Elon musk's update;
Nice;

Better if this has Edit button to edit posts. üòÖ;
It's lacking but decent. I'd love to make this a permanent alternative to X but until there's a search function it's not used as much as I'd like to.;
I download this app and join it with my Instagram and the next I found that my Instagram is hacked and it was very troubled situation for me so for me it was a very bad experience with this app it should be more aware about the privacy;
I tried to log ƒ∞n but it gives me error, not to proceeding next after entering password. It shows some message.;
Nice app;

I Thought it was a Good interface...I liked how it gives you a Number for your Account I.D. Easy back and Forth with Instagram also üëå Nice Launch to the Team at Threads...Now only if you could get me back all of my old Instagram Accounts YOU Would be Amazing üëè üòÄ üòâ;

I am giving only one star because there is no separate tab For the threads of people whom i follow, All threads like old, new are all in same tab. Those p people i don't follow but their threads are on my timeline, totally rubbish;
Please support brother;
It's okay right now. The app needs some basic features. There is no algorithm for me to reach anyone. No communities to find. I think those two are very important. Being able to reach and find various communities that you take part in. Yeah, you can pull followers from instagram, but that's not completely efficient. They MIGHT be active.;

These app can hack your account my account also hacked.;

App is awesome i am in love with it, But, Users post something by expressing anything in words, And as a human there will be some mistakes while writing, So, Thread, Requesting u to provide edit option after posting a post in thread, Which can help thread users to correct their only mistake, A word or a letter, Rather than deleting complete post and rewriting again. Update this in ur platform, As soon as possible, Lots of love to entire thread. And i am waiting for lovely update from threads.;
Very bad app.. I'm not satisfied to use this..üòè then I deleted this thread app my Instagram account is deactivated..üòè is a cheating to me.. guy you all use X not this..üòè;

Found that Iam unable to delete threads account until I delete my insta account;
Add photo save option;
Good;
Don't use this app, you can not delete your account, once you create.;
While I do think the app has some potential, there are several problems. Some of them include the lack of photo filters when you upload photos, the inability to delete your Threads account without your Instagram account, the inability to use more than one account, and the app crashing several times when I log out, leading myself to delete data and cache rather frequently. I wish this app wasn't released prematurely and that Instagram gives more time to develop Threads as a more stable app.;
"I literally can't do anything on the app other than like other people's threads. As for adding my own, search or my activity I can't see or do anything - it keeps saying ""Sorry something went wrong. Try again"" and it's been that way for over a month now.";

What was meant to be Meta's version of Twitter, seriously seriously lacks. Seeing threads from people you don't follow? Seeing threads posted days ago as if they're new?

Yo, why profile being public can't be switched back to private?? Everytime i am trying to do so it is saying sorry we have encountered some problem..?

I really don't see the point in this app. Also, I really don't like how you can't delete your Threads account without deleting your Instagram.. edit: Can't get rid of the threads button. It's so dumb. I don't use it.;
What's the point of this app exactly? Trying to make a new Twitter? Why not just integrate it to the already existing insta app?;
Was working great at first but suddenly decided that there was activity on an unknown device and has blocked access. It was only being used on one device. Tried uninstalling, power cycle, reinstall but no luck there. It is now uninstalled and will stay that way until there is a desktop version to try.;
Nice try;

The overall experience of the app is good but the thing is I cannot change my bio since the very launch of this app. I have reported this bug 3 times through app but still nothing has been done so far. I hope developers will resolve this asap.;

Hi This app is good app . Me not talk not good This is good App but more updates. New Update point ( video upload apsan, video create,and more . Thank you;
It's tied to Instagram... Uninstalled. I was hesitant anyway because of Meta. Lots of false positive AI generated reviews. Note: Im not a fan of Twitter.;
The most important feature of social networks is that it does not have the ability to put hashtags. There is no possibility of correct arrangement of words and sentences in Persian writing, and words, sentences and symbols are inserted in different places. There is no way to know which followers are following us unless we check manually. It does not have the ability to tell a story. Direct message is not possible. Many settings are related to Instagram settings, which causes problems for this us;
Bekar app hai time waste;
So bad why Bad, why can't I just watch who I follow, why explore and random?;

What new innovation is it? It could be better if you try to challenge twitter with open source platform to revolutionize free speech. But this just seems like a new way to collecting the data and earning sales revenue. I order to delete thread profile, have to delete insta account as well. What a pathetic idea. Hope some one find the instagram replacement. So, I can delete both.;
Phenomenal üôåüèæ;
If after singing in I am by default start following then why I can't get followers by default. It's an Instagram app so if I am following someone and that person is also following me on Instagram then why it doesn't happen in Threads by default because we have already approved each other in one app then what's the point of doing all that again. While copying X (Twitter) Meta has created mess and the most funny thing is you can't even delete this mess.;
Nice;
it is possible to share insta reels to threads right away?;
Nice;
I am experiencing a frustrating bug with this app and I hope the developers can fix it soon. The bug occurs when I try to open multiple thread links from another app. The first link opens fine, but the second link does not load properly. It shows the content of the first link instead of the second one. The only way to open the second link is to close the app completely and then click on it (the link) again. This is very inconvenient and annoying. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible.;

BLUF - to delete threads you have to delete instagram! They're collecting a massive amount of data on you too. Remember, META is an ADVERTISING COMPANY with a disgusting POLITICAL AGENDA, not a social media company only people giving this garbage positive reviews are employees. Another app by a greedy anti-american woke company that needs to disappear. Mark Zuckerberg, the democrat puppet, needs to fade away back to the slime he was bred from. We don't need your censorship on another platform!!;

I like the concept of Threads. It's basically Twitter without the craziness that has taken over that app. I also like that it is attached to your Instagram account. However, the lack of hashtags makes it very hard to find communities and topics to follow. Fix that, and the app should go far.;

The more I follow the less I see credible information from trusted sources. When I do finally see a credible post it's already 16hrs -2days old.

Information is washed out the more you follow which has discouraged me from following any more accts & now I'll be looking to unfollow as a way to weed out anything that prevents me from seeing up to date credible information.;

It's a Tweeter (RIP) connected to Instagram. It's just like The Transporter movie but without Jason Stetham. THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS You eather can't delete it or you must delete it with your instagram account which means the instagram policy about supporting Threads sucks.

A feable copy of Twitter but less interesting and with fewer features. Like with all Meta products the algorithm is terrible, so you don't see a timeline of interesting or relevant threads. Glitchy, keeps alerting you to the same old notifications. Had it for about a month and uninstalled it, it's not worth it when you have better alternatives.;

Zuck proves again he got lucky with Facebook which also is lackluster compared to social media apps these days. So it's Twitter with none of the cool features and just fills your feed TikTok style with sponsored creators pimping out ads. Wow who would've guessed after how badly the vr meta failed he would make another god awful app but here we are. Hopefully blue sky is good cause this just ain't it;
üëéüèø;
Bad result;
Very good app for Instagram users as Well.;

Dear threads, I think it would be a great idea if you put save pictures option...this is my honest opinion thank you;
interface in not preferrable;
simply horrible.;
i love it so much;
Horrible. Doesn't work.;
trust me this app is a waste of storage. tbh. just sits there n do nothing. i would give no stars if i could of.;
Not good;
Just the same stuff U can see on Instagram or Facebook. Useless.;
I miss the old Twitter so much but this design is much more pleasing. Reminds me of when apps weren't trying to all be the same and instead using their own appeal to draw new users. The aesthetic is more pleasing than twitters though, good design and good improvement. The only thing I wish is that you could message each other. It would be great to link Instagram messages to threads and have them sync.;
Cheap app.....;
This app is instant, bring the option of BS chat, more and more people will start using it.;
Please disable video auto play. Add hastags to search. Add lists.;
Great!;
Nothing is special in this app . Like other social medias. As same as Instagram.;
Can't delete thread account;

Where's the drama at man. Your app gonna fall without the drama. MAKEPEOPLE FIGHT;

Whats the actual point? The app is glitchy, it crashes, videos don't play, and it is just a smaller version of instagram.;
They should provide where one can chat with friends Although it is easy to make friends there but they lack means of communicating with people, unlike other social media app;
It's pretty hooking;
It's ok, roughly similar to Twitter. I would suggest themes, change the color of the toolbar area or something. It's more for looks than functionality but it would be coolü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è;

Happy to see this app but help me get my account back;
The app focuses too much on the global feed and miscalculates. I get shown countless posts in Russian merely because I'm subscribed to three Russians on Instagram. Why would this mean I want to read in Russian? It doesn't even let me filter the feed by my language of choice.;

Hello, although I am active on this application and I believe that the application is wonderful, the results do not satisfy me. I am active and publish many daily posts, but my interaction is weak. I would like to advise you to work on the application more and to add features and features in order to make it easier to use. The user feels pleasure.;
Awesome. Quick and easy.;
Just downloaded the app but i can't open it or access it, not my expectations;
Nah. Don't need this.;
Let's just say it's Twitter's little brother which is little better nothing else but i enjoy it a lot keep you updated on everything so i would like to give it 4 stars but few more updates I would give it 5 stars;
What's the point of this. Feels pretty useless.;
this is bad apps, i mean there is no free speak and ban account for nothing;

The app crashes when you scroll too far. Afterwards, it then crashes on launch. When it isn't crashing, there is no messaging feature, and the button to display just your follows is concealed behind the logo. I can't honestly praise it.;

"So far the ""Threads"" app is giving alot vibe. But some features need to be included to make it more engaging for users worldwide. For example a Chat section, where two people can discuss & also maybe group chats, that is like users get to create group chats for people to join based on their interests & thereby expanding their threads community even more. Also the app is really great, so it would be very appreciated if meta can add these features i put down here.";

Flop. Delete this app and resolve your issues on Instagram. Especially the low reach on Instagram that people are experiencing.;
It's robbed from Elon Musk üò°;
Its look like twitter but doesn't match twitter level. I hope this app very but this app felt my expectation ..;
My Ccrriisstine account was on my old phone but switxhed phone and is shows my profile and about but not the rest of the profile;
Good..;
trash af;
Serves no purpose, just seems like another way to push ads on users for revenue. Pretty much does the same thing as FB and Instagram. Needs recreating with it's own identity.;
Good;
The app cause issues for IG app and also effects my other app so I deleted it and my problem got fix ,it was closing my instagram when I did try to open my app ig it was effects my instagram app.;
Perfect thanks so much for your coustom and hard work looking after my phone apps and development keep up the good work you do xXx;
Please.... landscape tablet UI support....;

Propaganda lies and sin. Overdoing it on the animals more than people, I think it's a people internet, not an animal internet. tired of seeing more animals And anthropomorphic. It's pitiful. it's not entertaining. Cute, is become boring and guess what? The animal shelters are filling up because people are disappointed and their pets. .;
its like if twitter was made by disney. the vibes were good for maybe one whole hour of release. does anyone even use this anymore lmfao;

Twitter without the topics, the hashtags and private messaging. Nothing to keep me engaged. Plus, I'm seeing posts in my timeline from users I don't follow. Not even Instagram does that. Some of these users, I've never even heard of. Please add more to this app;
The app is nothing like x I think you guys need to better its more like a off brand version of it like do better;
Useless;
I love this app, as it has way fewer spam bots than most, and a great community. BUT IT'S SO BUGGY, I CANT UPLOAD PHOTOS half the time it says failed to upload, crashes constantly, and is just absolutely too buggy. Needs a lot more features and then it will be a great app. Not being able to post just randomly makes the app nearly unusable.;

Dear Developers Thread app is a very cute app. But if you keep it separate from Instagram, it can be an even better app.My point is that Thread and Instagram are two separate apps. They should be different. Thanks;
Excellent alternative to that right-wing cesspool known as Twitter.;
LUCKY;
Everyone has the right to express their political and economic opinions. However, it is important to remember that sharing pictures of individuals who are against Islam may not be respectful or productive. We have to give a shut-up call to control these anti-Islamic activities. But when I gave a shut-up call, the thread removed my account. #TLP #ŸÑÿ®€å⁄© ŸÑÿ®€å⁄© €åÿß ÿ±ÿ≥ŸàŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÑ€Å Ô∑∫;

Useless;
I am simply a Threader;
Poorly tested and early version;
Good;
was able to download fine, but after a few days of settling in and enjoying the app, everything stopped working. I can't post. Can't reply to posts or even like posts that show up in my feed. I can't see any activity on the posts I was able to share - can't reply to anyone. All I can do is scroll my feed. And now with the launch of the desktop version, I can't access that either - won't even let me download. Way to lock people out, Meta.;

wow üò≤;
It's the Truth Social for Democrats. If you avoided Truth Social because of the right political BS, you will want to avoid this app. The app is clunky, glitched, and sometimes completely unresponsive. How can you trust a company to make a good app when their biggest announcement was releasing the website? Just uninstall it and move back to X (Twitter).;
Excellent first month. As new features are added, the user experience will certainly get even better;
There is no photo saving option...;
Does not work won't let me sign in;
super;
there are few trolls and bots on Threads, and the discourse is mostly respectful it's a big step up.;

has high potential to become a great social media platform but lacks the polish and optimization needed on a modern day based app. would like to see future improvements;
Very bad üòî app for me;
if it had edit I'd give it 6 stars;
Hvyv v vu;
ok;
Better than twitter;
It's a great app, It shows only personalized posts on its feed and we can choose the following mode only too. It'd be better if we can use hashtags and add shorts/reels though.;
Easy to use, trolls are easily blocked, and sharing content means you get sooo much more information each day, from like-minded individuals.;
This app is horrible. It simply does not even open, crashes straight back to the home screen. My phone specs aren't great, I will say that, but they should definitely be able to run a knock-off twitter.;
Copy;
Instagram & threads app is very good...but my view & like not coming,,plss instagram my view & like increase please;
So far so good. needs tweaking though. In time.;
Not quite there yet, but it's got it's good points, community, noticeable lack of obnoxious berks, I could go on , find out for yourself üëç;
It's really good, but Please add translator. Many thanks;
Very bad aap;
The only thing that made me delete it was its black icon, which doesn't match the dark mode of my phone;

Floods you with posts from people you don't follow, does not show your own posts to anyone else, just like Twitter.;
"Useless developers!!! I updated the app to the newest version again, but it still doesn't work and constantly says, ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again"". This is frustrating! I tried to clean cache and data, reinstall, different internet and wifi connections, with and without vpn, but nothing works. I truly want to use it, but I can't. :( I have sent the logs, but they are useless and can't fix it or change the message.";

I like the variety of posts from all sorts of people and I don't feel the least but threatened when I post something. Most of my followers followed me first so I feel safe. ü§ó;

so bad;
Better than Twitter. If you dislike n@zis drop Twitter and get Threads.;
My favourite new site. LOVE not having so many ads you cannot see content.;
A True Banger!;
Threads is all political garbage. It's just a sequel to what Twitter turned out to be after a while. I don't highly recommend it;
Interesting;
Good lord x/Twitter would be dead in an instant if this app had literally any features.;
Was fine ,until this last update. Now it sucks!;
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è;

once all the features needed are installed, this app will be a five star.;

"Feels like a particularly imperfect and unfinished beta version, but it has allowed me to ease my up and away flight from Facebook, which has now become a great void of old family members and(very) old friends to a new, less jaded crowd. I thrive on chaos; so it works for me - in this moment. Not sure how sticky it is. I've lost as many new followers as I've gained. Maybe because I don't know anybody here, they don't know me, and sometimes we end up following the wrong people.";

I really like it but it's currently missing something. Threads should have a pinned thread feature like Twitter has. The pinned thread provides context to people visiting a profile and can provide additional/related resources. When I send someone a link to a Tweet I wrote, they see the pinned post on my Twitter and it provides additional context beyond what's in the short bio. Some profiles have pinned a long series of Tweets with a link in each Tweet, which provides centralized information.;
Wow very nice üëç;

Thread has been so great since lunching and i love how smooth and user friendly it is. I am expecting more things like ads monetization, and so on.;
jost copying twitter (x);
As soon as I logged in, I suddenly required BLEACH after what I saw;
Very happy with the community on Threads and pleased to see the Zuck crew are rolling out enhancements and fixes fairly rapidly. I used to be a QA analyst in my employer's IT department and I've been impressed with how few issues there have been since the launch. Looking forward to future functionality upgrades.;
"Still all tabs/screens except news feed are shown with ""Something went wrong"". App is not usable. For two month no reaction, several reports sent and I'll better not use SM at all then using this...";

A pleasant atmosphere and interactions in a place to throw my random thoughts;
it's just Twitter lite;
For my intents and purposes, threads is like a sticky note.;
For me the app is unusable. Not really the app itself but the feeds. My feed is almost entirely full of suggested threads to the extent that I never see posts from those I follow. It's kind of like tiktok for text.;
When the privacy policy rivals a Star Wars opening text, you know it's shady;
Great place to get news, engage with reasonable people and follow your favorite celebrities. More news and search is needed;
Love it.;
Very nice app;
twitter but cheap, also let us download the fkng images;
Why do we need another app tied to Instagram which is ultimately tied to facebook. And why is Instagram suggesting my friends requested me to download this garbage. -14 /10;
Poor , twitter is better;
Good;
missing the gif option ü•∫ü•∫ must have please. an error that keeps showing my Threads are posting and never goes away lol. but in general I'm loving it. Honestly, I haven't seen another social media platform so safe for peeps. Threads is a place where you can express yourself, build community, make friendships and know you can be genuinely you. From the bottom of my üíô, thank you;
viable alternative to twitter, just needs to continue building out features and attracting and retaining users;

Great platform.;
to not say zeroü´£;
It's okay, but there's no following feed and the algorithm isn't great most of the time it doesn't show me things I'm interested in;
App is fine. The $15/mo BS to do what they should be doing, keeping our accounts safe, isn't. The play store is loaded with billionaires who do not care about these reviews, and that includes Google. We're not Forced to use either. It's a choice. That's clear. What isn't clear is the information, who it's sold to, and exactly what is collected from us, no matter the permissions on your device. Aside from all of this, the updates are staggering these days. That's Data breaches talking out loud;
Needs an explore/topic search feature, an edit button and the option to seperate your account from Instagram.;
Trying to be something it will never be.;

Some improvements have been made, but needs bookmarks and hashtags badly. And better responses to reports of actual violence and death threats by other users. Overall am enjoying the app, much more friendly vibe here without the rampant hate.;
I appreciate the chance to have something similar to Twitter of old. but there are so many features missing that honestly just make it a waste of time. the inability to use functional hash tags is a huge one, especially for people relying on social media for their small businesses or art commissions. no edit button. just several other little things that need improvement.;
greatest app i have ever used in my life on god if yall need a representative or commercial figure please let me know!;
enjoy viewing the different threads, ease of use. still wish they had an edit/delete button, way of categorizing content, and mode for saving favorite posts/threads.;
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è;
Better than the other place because the community isn't full of negative ppl. It's still early days of course but the app is usable and is being developed, with regular updates.;

REMOVED. A waste of space, a waste of time. It's pure spam, an advertising platform and showing and pushing posts from accounts I don't follow nor do I have any interest in. I accept there has to be some advertising, but this is beyond OTT! There's nothing encouraging me to stick with it. I get more than enough adverts and spam from all over the place. I'm NOT canon fodder.;

we need favorite to save what we love;
its very helpful;
Absolutely no need for this app whatsoever. It's all been done before.;
üòÄ;
@threads is already a wonderful place to be. Proper, intelligent engagement with like-minded souls, more so than I've experienced on any social app. Especially on politics, which has been a joy! But there are frustrations: a 'sticky' feed that doesn't make sense chronogically. Over-focus on the last person you reacted to from the algorithm. No topic search facility, and little content from top UK brands and news outlets. Please sell hard to them! üôè Great work, Threadmeisters - it's fun here!;
The app is very boring. Twitter is much better;
Xnxx aata hi ni h isme download krna hi bekar h;
It's okay. I just don't have many close friends and family that use it. My following and interactions on the app has been slower than I thought or expected. Although, it has only been out to the public for a few months. I will keep it for now.;
superb;
I love it;
The app is good so far. It is fairly new and is still being worked on but I'd recommend it.;

a great Alternative to Twitter as it feels like 2015 Twitter before the MAGAs and Elon Musk pretended all ideas are equal and lying is acceptable behaviour, I recommend Theads 100% as it's slowly gaining more features and I love how every attempt by the crowd who ruined twitter come there then run away as there not welcome, also the sensible censorship makes it an app I'd be fine see kids using unlike twitter which is basically 4chan lite now. Nothing more pleasant then a gore free social media.;
Copy of Twitter mark Zuckerberg just wanted to be like king Elon Musk;
A work in progress, I think. It needs to improve navigation and search options.;
three stars coz I want zuck to still update the app;
Worst;
"i love it but can being more freedom like X because ""something"" is prohibited to post...";
A decent replacement for TwiX in more ways than one, and getting better all the time.;
The is awesome but my problem is the app won't let me do anything and I can't follow anyone please fix it;
Really great way of communicating with like minded people...;
cant hide the threads badge in instagram profile;
Good;
3 stars for now. The app still needs more features to get it to 5 stars. But other than that, works like a charm.;
Buggy with greyed posts;
Bruv i cant evan log in it says the password wrong also it looks like a straight copy of Twitter and a lil rebanding;
Worst social media app I have tried isko dekh kr social media se man htt gya yrr;
For me, Threads came out from nowhere and hit the ground running. The functionality has a ways to go, and they will get there. I am very happy to see so many familiar accounts and am pleased with the content.;
Amazing app;

Could you not put a edit feature into it I always found it frustrating that you could not edit on twitter i mean there's no need to copy twitter down to the last i you could just improve on it and a edit feature would be brilliant...;

It's incorporating better features as time goes on, and I'm building a better community than I found on its predecessor, its ex.;
Very bad copy of twitter;
Hopefully we will see this app improved so I can increase my rating. Currently there is still enough functionality missing to knock it down a couple stars.;
Excellent start impressive in fact. It'll get higher than 3 stars when they figure out how to show me stuff closer to real time especially during sports. probably should do a Superbowl add encouraging people to threet about the game.;
"Less hate on threads than on ""X"".";
Still a long way to go to search topics, find subject matter experts, and be found by those not family or friends already. But it does feel less angry and toxic than Twitter.;
Why is my badge still there when I dont even have a profile?;
dull af;
Bad;
way better than being a bird...;
Trolls few and far between. No Musky stank on the app.;
Better than Twitter;

I've found THREADS to be a wonderful place to meet and connect with new friends and business colleagues.

Now that search is up and running, this feels way more like a proper Twitter replacement. There are a few quality of life things that would help, like trending topics and hashtags, but, for now, it's pretty great!;
Meet at the new spot!;
It's a very good app I love itüíôüíô;
üå≥Freedom to post ‚õ∞Ô∏è Thank you Threads ‚úåÔ∏è;
Not good experience....need a lot more correction;
Still developing its core features but honestly, I really dig this app. Been checking it regularly since launch. It even got me to start paying attention to my Instagram again.;
It's getting there.;
I like it. Simple And easy to use.;
with trending feature included in the next update, threads can be wild;
Bad then Instagram;
I do like it. I like the atmosphere better than any social site so far. It's difficult to leave a critical review when I know it's not a finished project but it does leave quite a few features to be desired.;
Not acceptable in front of X;
Was kind of hoping for more here, but it's non functional. It'd be just what us migrants from X wanted, if the app wasn't a buggy mess. Don't bother if you want to actually communicate with people: posting or uploading doesn't work at all.;
With the introduction of search, this app is rapidly becoming the real deal. improvements keep coming on a regular basis.;
100% AWESOME;
Its a good replacment twitter when you want get away from how toxic twitter is. But I would like a following page so i can see the posts from people i follow instead of them including people i don't.;
There's nothing which will make you hooked up with this app like instagram and if you have free wifi then download this for nothing. X is far better than this. X has a lot more potential than this. This is just ctrl V of it.;

I can't log in to my Instagram or meta account to use threads. I checked several times, my info was correct. It's excruciating.;
The app is good but it needs new features like the message tab and like trending topics;
Threads is like Twitter but good;
good, continues to develop.;
Where is that search option? I can only search people.;
Itz officail my fb insta good threadson;

mind blowing;
Nice;
Nice you Threads app to atajh on Instagram;
trending topics need to be updated more;
Why am I seeing a bunch of posts from random accounts I don't follow???;
Requiring an account in another social media site is absurd. I don't want an Instagram account. Total fail on Meta's part.;
really good. could use a dedicated messaging center in-app.;

Such an useless app, if I could give it zero start, I would've given it a zero star;

Great stuff. Getting better and better every week/month.;
A more enjoyable experience here than you know where.;
Great Communication with no * Funny Stuff* as in that Stupid X . Twitter and Bird I was used to. but that X is as Eerie as it's owner.. Thanks to Mark Zuckerberg for making Social Media tolerable...;
Copycat L üëé;
Another boring scrolling app..;
I can see posts but that's about it. I can't see replies (so what even is a thread?) nor can I see anything in activity. It's been stuck this way for weeks.;
It's nice though but the need for hashtags is a must have feature so meta please make this possible in the next update;
amazing üëè;
its an amazing aap.;
Tqq;
easy to use;
Twitter is betterüò≠üòÇü§ùüèº;
IG's awful AI flagged my IG account as a bot, an account that I've had for years, right after I installed this app. Permanently suspended me so that my account is now unrecoverable. What an experience. Wouldn't install again.;
Needs Switch account feature!!;
Its amazing;
Threads its great!;
For now, this is way better than Twitter. No ads, very little nastiness, and much like Twitter when it first started.;
Useless app. Third class copy;
You need to fix the erros and bugs. I haven't been able to see my likes or follows since I created my profile. I don't see the point of dragging with this app if it doesn't work. At the moment, I can only see the news feed, and I can't even post anything.;
nice;
As soon i open this app;
Threads feels nice to be on, hope that atmosphere stays (and it has web and search now if that matters to you);
Not possible to delete threads account without deleting Instagram account.;
3 rd class;
Good;
Good;
Threads application is very good;
Needs to have DM capability,edit,and an easier way to find out if people you've followed are following back.;
getting way better. still missing features but golly what an improvement over the dumpster fire that was a great site;
At first, I was wondering why we need another social media app. Now I can't get enough!!! This one is different. I love it.;
Good;
"wonderfull app. less nazis than brand ""X"". Easy to use.";
"One big annoyance right now is that there isn't an option to skip loading links in the internal browser. I'd like to load links externally with my preferred browser instead. The app also frequently jumps back to the ""For you"" feed rather than sticking with the ""Following"" view (and ""Following"" seems pretty buggy where it doesn't really refresh properly).";

"I like threads because I'm not trolled by MAGAs here as much as the ""other"" platform. It could use a bit of tweaking though, like an easier way to tell which activities you've already seen, an EDIT button and a saved draft option. Other than those things, it's greatüòä";

A solid platform. Always room for improvement.;
Nice;
So far, it's been a positive experience.;
Though, still in the early stages and still lacks a few features, Threads had a potential to grow, and the recently implemented keyword search feature really helps a lot! I'm looking forward to seeing what Meta brings to the table with their new Threads social media app! And, I hope to grow a community on there as well to support Disney's underrated animated series, 101 Dalmatian Street!üòÅ;
Could and should be more developed by now. It's good now but needs more features and basics to truly put X out to pasture.;
I love it. I never got into the other place but this is friendly, supportive and fun. It's so nice to not have nasties spoiling it. Now we have a search which is fab. üòä;
Very good;
Super positive community üíô;
better moderation of content, less prone to seeing hate content.;
Sasta Twitter or I say X;
I love this app m daughter loves it too;
It glitches and some of the features are missing;
Way, way, way better than the xitter.;
I love it! Adult political discourse. We all look out for one another!;
Nothing to do;
A scam website is coded better than this app;
Greatt appp ‚ú®;
Best Xitter replacement out there. And getting better. I know it will be BETTER than Twitter in the long run.;
Very nice;
it's good;
This is actually a really nice app. I've found a great community on here. And while other reviews are right that it's missing things, they ship more stuff every week (good stuff! Features not bugs!). Most basics are working, everything else is in the pipeline.;
sweet and classy;
I'm more than upset!! I'm angry and irritated!! I regret installing this app! I want to delete it but I can't. I feel like I'm being held hostage. I also want the icon removed from my IG account but there's no way to remove that. Of course! I've Googled and tried EVERYTHING! It's still there. They should have created a disclaimer to warn people (before installation) that there is no option to delete without deleting IG too. They're out of line for this. ü§¨ü§¨;
Copy of X(twitter);
Absolutely love this app. Great place to follow others with your same interests. Plus zero ads.;
Se supon√≠a que iba a ser lo m√°ximo, pero se ha quedado corto y veo que mucha gente ya ni sube threads;
a bit easier on the heart and head than Twitter or whatever we're calling it these days still has a ways to go, but strides are made weekly to improve the experience;
Constantly crashes on opening;

Quite poor. Still lacking so many features.;

I jumped ship from Twitter to Threads when it went online. So far the experience has been much better and I hope this continues into the future.;
I was on the Bird App from way back, '06. It got bad and went worse, and I was sucked right into that scene, and a lot of its weird and angry discourse. There was a point where I found people that I could relate to, and there were cool things, and it went to Hell. Threads is working to be the good version of this, I think, if only to spite Musk. I think that's a great reason to build a place where the good parts of Twitter thrive. Threads, Ho! Thanks for the great free product! Great work!;
Great app that's getting better all the time. They keep adding more and more functionality.;
Threads is better than Twitter, because it is fast than Twitter and it's amazing to joined both apps Instagram and threads.;
You should use twitter;
Still much to be desired as far as Quality of Life features, but remains infinitely preferable to Twitter. A safer social media experience, though being a Meta IP you have to live with the personal information storage/mining/sharing.;
This app is a disappointment, it's lacking so much compared to most major social medias.;
can't search too easy can't find people location tagging does not work no Hashtags;
üëåüëå;
Lot to work on, yes the future is bright. The app has potential.;
So cool to have this. Easy to use, great community, lots of news etc. Haven't used X-itter in months.;
The stricter, lamer, helicoptoparented, version of Twitter, minus all the fun parts and with more spying.;
Love the app! Goodbye Twitter/X!;

needs # and loolk for topics options;
its okay it just the creater wont be able to see hi/her replies;

I really like the app. Continued listening to users, updating & getting better. I'm no longer a twit.;
It has less/inferior features than X and the scrolling is buggy/unresponsive 90% of the time (that's the only app I have seen with this problem).;
Very nice bro;
The app is still in its larval stage, not quite mature, but it's getting better all the time. Also, right-wing psychopath trolls are at a minimum, at least in the early stages.;

A place where woke is not a dirty word and people are supportive towards each other. Somewhere you can ask about what you know nothing about and people will answer without insults. Getting better with every update. A good place for X Xers tired of the toxicity.;
Just keeps getting better and better and shows some great topics from your interests.;
It would be a five star if (or will be when) I had the ability to make lists or groups or some means with which to group the people I follow and pull those threads up together at will. I want to have family, writers, artists, politicians, news, etc easily grouped. I still go to the X mess to see my FIRST list for trusted news in the morning. Would rather do it here.;

I hate when Threads doesn't rotate on my device. We are in 2023, not in 2000. Also, threads is very ugly compared to Twitter. I dislike Elon but Threads has more functionalities than Threads. Zuck knows Threads is a copy of Instagram.;

Extremely unresponsive. As soon as I open the application, the screen scrolling gets crazy and absolutely unreadable.;
The app lacks the search option to seek specific topics based on a keyword. It claims that it offers it and even notified me that I can use it. But when I boot up the app and try using a keyword to search for any posts discussing a specific topic, it just shows me the usual boring list of accounts that are using that keyword as their user name. It amazes me that such a basic function is not yet widely available.;
Nice;
Very good;

Please add how the feature like how many engaged to a post etc;
no hashtag support yet.;
-no rooms for dm's -no room to choose topic/s of interest -thread should be an app of its own and not tied with IG;
Best of all time;
Missing a lot of features, but it has a chance.;
Looking forward to updates to bring even more functionality, like editing, to the app.;
Not the best app right now, but hoping on new features to come;
perfectly good and steadily getting better.;
I Enjoy This App. I Hope to make A living From Threads Someday.;
less static than the maniac many feel comfortable here which makes this a good experience similar CoSo with higher speed;

This looks less like a twitter clone and more like a Facebook comment box where people are fighting or nagging. Not recommended.;

A gimmick aimed at exploiting the Twitter exodus. Only difference b/w this & regular IG is that the text is above the photo and not below. Also first thing I log in and see is pictures of young girls (minors) with random men (many of whom I suspect would be adults) commenting on it. Terrible content moderation although I'm sure there's nothing here that wouldn't already be on the regular app.;
This app is the worse version of twitter;
Love the clean look and feel and the more positive vibe. Have permanently left the 'other' place. (Am finding that I spend more time on Threads than I ever did there.) Patiently waiting as new features roll out.;

whenever I upload multimedia, I think that they get uploaded already after some time of letting it upload. But the next day when I check on my posts apparently they weren't uploaded so I have to do it again. it ruins my schedule of content posting;

Missing key features. Finding content is weak. No volume control on videos is particularly irksome. Browser version is even worse. Twitter has become a toxic wasteland.

Still garbage! It really doesn't bring like minded folk together. I rarely see any posts I'm into from strangers for me to connect with (follow). A friend from Twitter told me she doesn't see anything on Threads of mine. They need to come up with a way to link folk. Hash tags have worked for ages, surely there's no ownership on hash tag labels? If so come up with something else and fast. Meta are trying to create a twitter overnight. They need slow down and build alongside the users joining.;

It's a good app. I like it. You can talk to anyone but there is a problem that we can't post my pic but we can write and that's I like it. I didn't get any follow request but in Instagram I got daily 15 requests. I think Insta is best then that. You should also try the app. I think the Threads company can improve some little things that would be best. For Insta and Threads viewers. Like you have your threads and you want to check your insta then in 1 click you can go to insta there is a option.;

I feel that it has better vibes than Twitter, for which I hope Threads will continue to maintain that.;
very good app;
Nice and ok;

Threads is still at the beginning stages. I am hopping it will get better, have trends etc.;
Abdul Kalam Mansuri;
Nice app, looking forward to more updates and more users.;
My only complaint is, I have two accounts under one email and on the browser I can't use one of the accounts because it only loads in the one. When I try to sign in with my email and password it says the password is wrong when it isn't, and there's no way to use that account. Works fine on my phone, not on the browser. I still haven't been able to see the browser version.;
Still think there is a ways to go to replace my use on Twitter. Main issue is how new threads are loaded. Seems like at times they load the newest first and you have to scroll down until you get to old ones. Next time it holds your place at the last read and then you scroll up to the newest which is preferred for me. Works be nice to have a settings that you can put what you like.;
early twitter vibes;
cool but updates comes late and some problems likes has not direct;
Can't delete account and it always shows on the Instagram bio.;
It's apart of instagram and Facebook. They hacked my account, nobody protected it. They just placed their hate towards me. Messed up every relationship I tried to build. I don't just blame my enemies, it's those who also allowed for it to happen. It is what it is. I never met H.E.R. some people made it seem like I was bad luck. When I got haters. So, y'all can't blame me.;
Zuckerberg needs to get rid of the very spammy links to stories. It harkens back to a time when a reader wouldn't read, knowing spam wirh all the pop-ups were coming NO THANKS. But. This forum better than the horrible Musk Twitter!;
this will take over;
Well right iff the bat I have not used it yet but thought it was nice addition to Instagram but y is it not in main app as a extra option in main app. It should be. & its data it can collect if not careful is way 2 extreme. Only use the required. No reason 4 it to know religion, acess texts to texts, which are optional but still y. & be careful not to give any optional data 4 them to collect. I know y they doing it because data is king. & algorithms will use it all to know what u want to see/buy;
Too intrusive. A security concern.;

It's still early but with a new desktop version and search it's becoming more usable.;
This app is designed to segregate the discourse of public opinion so that parasite nazis in american politics can get joe biden elected again. Stand up and say no to masks, say no to CBDCs, say no to V 4 X, say no to BRICS. If you dont know what im talking about, look it up. You will need to know because you're going to make a choice before 2030 if we're going to let the devil win and the UN takes over, killing 7 billion. Otherwise, we can help god and save 7 billion. We are being demoralized.;
Unless you actively have your phone in dark mode, there is no dark mode. Stupid. Instagram has this feature, why is it hard to implement on threads? And the app has been out for a while now. Dark mode helps my vision/migraines so it's an accessible feature to include, and it really isn't asking for much.;

No tags, difficult to explore and find new content. Sometimes, it doesn't even let you upload. Keeping my Twitter.;
it's ok. but I don't see a translation capability, and I can't see how many threads/posts I have.;

excellent... and improving steadily in the right direction. well done team. please keep it up. (edit button)?;
A magnificent app, it's where I rant and talk about my problems, ngl Threads is my safe space, a vault and Threads is my everything. Thank you for building this app.;
Installed this from play store and have used it for a few weeks. Just now I started the app, got an error message and then a page saying I might have been phished and provided a link to supposedly fix it. Needless to say I did not and immediately uninstalled it. Someone has managed to hijack this app. I no longer trust it.;
the navigation has me baffled. the entire environment seems to be muted in some way. doesn't feel alive, if you get me drift.;
What's the point lol. It's dead on arrival.;
This is just a Twitter knowoff;
"Made a few reports about dangerous individuals, Instagram response was ""due to the high volume of reports we were not able to review your request"" That's exactly how dangerous individuals get to do crime using their platform, solution: Hire more people to investigate reports, why run a social Media platform if it's too overwhelming and you can't manage it properly now Thread. Lots people offering their account up for sale porn and paying $5k scams. Mark Zuckerberg stop bumming Elon Musk disgrace";

It's sucks;
Instagram threads apps for my working on insta;
I open the apps with ma insta account and i didn't post anything or share anything, all i did was saving some cars and anime photo that's it and after 2/3 minute ma account get disband saying i did something wrong to violate policy what's happening fix this issues please. I only download this app just 5 min ago and getting ban ? Really ?;
Soo bad;
The app is good but its missing some regular and basic features. Features like messaging are missing. They need to modernize this app if they want to compete with the best ones in the market.;
Such a bad experience. The app asked me to log out 10 mins after i installed it for the first time.;
threads is pure iterative detailed design creativity exposed in application software. Instagram desires and creators know their stuff... it's a gem of ann app if you remember to curate the people and puns you follow carefully. and jumping and engage. the early Threadsters remind me of early twitter In Toronto. I have a bias for early adopters of novel social media.;
No good, it keeps crashing.;
Profile disabled on the day of download. Rather stick to instagram.;
Good;
It's okay okay kind of app;
I'm enjoying what interaction I'm capable of doing in advancing a more positive dialogue of some truly scary things that are happening. And the trolls trying to drag me into their muck are as easy to deal with as tapping on a Block Button.;
Threads is an enjoyable social space with a lot of positive vibes and potential. The app is still growing with needed updates and improvements. not as many brands or businesses are active there now as on other networks. fun place though.;
Aap is really good but I am really fed-up that every video is muted by default and when I unmute video don't play.;
What a waist;
Bad;
Copy pasted from Twitter . Creat your own ideas;
"Was invited via Instagram to join Threads, so I did. Checked back half an hour later and discovered my account has been ""disabled for repeatedly posting material that violated their Community standards"" etc. I haven't even had a chance to post anything yet. get your act together, Threads!";
Nice i love it heheheh;
We cannot post automatically on instagram and threads at the same time. Does ot make any sense at all?;
Unbelievable..;
Love Threads .;
A trash app. It even flags your account and disables it even though you only literally posted a single thread.;

Threads disabled my account without any reason my threads were not against any guidelines why did they disabled my account I can't log in to my account pls give me back my account;
very nice and feel better app so nice;
It's a very interesting, with no frills attached app. Interesting & entertaining. Based on the feedback from elsewhere also they should update the app from time to time. Wish a bright future. Don't spoil with advertisements popping up in between. However you have to make money also. Nothing can b free. Things given free will b taken for granted & loose the shean over sometime. You know better than us, to run a show successfully. All the Very Best. Janakiraman Venkatachalam.;
It's amazing;

This is the Blue alternative to X. My biggest issue with Threads is the Video player. Most times, I get picture with no sound. It would be nice to have a video open in the player of my choice. I get that it is still in its infancy. So we wait.;
Okay so something happened just now. I had never used Instagram nor downloaded this app. I use xiomi and you know how apps show up on the screen for a security scan after they're downloaded? That happened. I was studying and had a timer on my screen and that just popped up. I dunno how the hell this happened but I want an answer because I know for sure I did not download it and if I had, it would show up earlier but it didn't. And I was studying for like 20 mins straight. I want an answer rn.;
saddam;
Uninspiring and not at all user friendly interface. If I'm going to be frustrated, I may as well just use Xwitter.;
wish I could interact more with people here.;
Deactivated me for posting a pictures of my own cats awful app wouldn't recommend at all. Has tighter restrictions then Facebook as I don't see how posting a few pictures or videos of your own pets is breaking any rules. I would highly recommend steering clear of this pathetic app. Sensorship on steroids. Should be deleted utter waste of time!!;
It was a worst experience for me Using this app I was the 1300+ person to install this app nd it showed on my insta profile but after deleting this app nd again installing I can't get my old ID nd now I'm 200 M + Person to install this app This app is worst nd I don't like threads and instagram in one place it should be separate apps from Meta Nd Yes, It can't be the alternative of twitter;

Its very bad this is policy is not good not install this app please cheak google review üëéüëé;
It's so much better than the ex-app! There are less people still, and it's still improving, but it's not a Nazi cesspool like Twitter! It has the potential to overtake Twitter if they keep the improvements coming!;
Dumbest app ever exist in play store;
it's amazing ü•≥;
love this so far;
This app is good but there is some problems like as #...... I want to see # in it....thank you;
Very impressed with the paid version - the only beef is with repositioning tiles in high is a little buggy but otherwise the advantages gained from a really beautiful UI is with that little bit of struggling at times to line them up. Best launcher ever !;
Today was the first time ever tried Threads. I had signed onto it through my Instagram account, but when I wanted to change my photo profile on my new account on Threads, my phone had froze and my account on Threads was instantly banned. I received the warning on Threads saying that I had violated the terms of agreement with too many postings! That does not make sense!;
Good app to meet new person and making conversations interesting;
easy to use and devoid of far right extremists.;
Please add time and date stamp for post;
It's a pity you can't submit zero stars. Closely resembles a left wingers thought process. No consistency, confused, a weak copy of something that has been done before. I guess this was required after all the snowflakes got butthurt on X. Hopefully as more people get on it, the lefty agenda will dwindle away into forgotten history where it belongs.;
Not available in my area for like, ever üòï;
I turn to social tools to build community, people I enjoy because of shared ideas, shared careers, experiences, beliefs. Threads is getting there. Tech advances (on their part) and patience (on mine) are making my experience better and better.;
"I wish you could have your timeline be ""newest threads first"" and not just ""here's what we want you to see.""";
What's the point? This is just another Twitter clone. Like Instagram, I wonder if we will have to pay for ads just to have people see your content on here, too!;
ÿ™ŸàŸäÿ™ÿ± ÿπŸÖŸÉ;
if you're gonna bite off of Twitter, at least have an edit button to make it worth while.;
"Was blocked from posting/liking/reposting/following/commenting for one week for ""sharing your account with a service that helps you get more followers..."" What does that even mean? Every time I tried to eg like a post, a notice popped up reminding me of the ban and asking whether I wanted to ""Tell us"" if I believed there was a mistake. I would click on ""Tell us"", but nothing ever happened & zero feedback. Extremely disappointing & unfair.";

I love this app is very easy to use and you can share you way of think, no matter if you've used before a similar app, you can open the app and start to use it is very intuitive. Other thing that I like this app is more moderate, you can scroll down and don't found adult contain for mistake, you only read what you follow. This app in my opinion is better than X, I used Twitter (X) for many years ago, but now I feel repetitive in Threads you can grow your account only with you contain.;

Following feed still shows people that I don't follow. If it were follows' follows or liked by follows, it would at least make sense, but it really should be direct follows only.;

Bad algorithms so you mostly see random people it thinks are ideologically aligned talking to themselves. Feature poor. lots of people sharing screenshots of popular tweets to no one in particular. We should all quit social media together and the companies are helping by ignoring what made them popular to begin with.;

Why do I need to install this app to set up a profile that could just as easily be provided via the web site? First thing it does after I finish is hit me with a bunch of useless accounts which I end up blocking? Requiring an Instagram account is even stupider.;
the actual threaded conversations are confusing and poorly designed. I can never see my original comments or replies, so it's difficult to follow any conversation that is replied to. I have no idea what they are replying to. I would categorize the organization of a thread as developed by someone inept and void of tech skills.;

It needs a feature to switch accounts like instagram for people with multiple handles, or if it does have such a feature already, it ends to be more accessible. Outside of that it looks promising üòÅ;
Best üëå;
Hope the next update has translate optionüòå;
as long as its free;
No point. The whole purpose of this app is to interact more closely with those people you want to follow, but so few people are actually using this. Then almost every single post shown to me is an account I don't follow or a topic that I'm not interested in. It literally doesn't accomplish the goal it's setting out to do. Download more;

with new features being added its a better platform than the ex-bird app;
You name it, Threads has it. Couldn't ask for better platform. It's regulated just enough to keep harassment and unhealthy elements down. It keeps racism and hate speech to a minimum.;

3* for now, way more positive place than Twitter and has the foundations to be everything Twitter could have been. Will immediately bump to 4* when #s get implemented to find communities easier!;
Very nice;
Overall the app is nice, still needs some improvements. Please add some animations on your pics and videos when we scroll them down after watching, and it would've been nice if this app was integrated with insta, switching apps is a bit redundantü§ï.;

My account was recently temporary suspended because of my personal opinions were not appreciated by another user. It would have been nice if Threads investigated prior to suspended an account. Just goes show your automatically found guilty before their investigated. Users beware that anyone can be suspended.;

Easy to use, great content, love it!;
At first I thought it was very useful, but now it seems that it is not very useful. It might be okay for kids;
0 stars for this app, it's horrible. you have inappropriate images and women doing inappropriate things... and many men writing to very young women... very bad;
Joyful and interesting.;
It's so refreshing to use a platform that improves features and fixes issues with out requiring hand outs.;
High Res pics, no need to use a 3rd party app to crop them, can upload 10 at a time. I like it a lot but needs a little improvements like seeing only ppl I follow in my feed, keywords or hashtags for searching content...;
Great App, soon it will offer everything that that other app does except it doesn't have that arrogant, self centered juvenile rich man thats has ever lived running the show;
we need # and search!;

Threads is a mess.;
good app , still needs a couple of items for a 5 star from me , it needs lists so I can see the folks I interact with the most, also a buffer when you enter threads from when you left instead of updating the moment you reopen it . It has a lot of good folks on it , much better than the bird app.;

The problem is, for me, you have to own or use your Instagram account to sign up for this app. At least, make a choice where u can use your instagram account or only email to sign up for new account.;

Not too bad so far. Managed to avoid racists and misogynists here, so that's good. Only wish the refreshing for new posts actually provided new posts. Seems to refresh every few hours with new posts, but like I'm suuuuper sure more people are posting beyond that.;
It's a nice app but there's some work to be done;
don't worry the only thing is that;
Very little interaction so far. May take off if Twitter starts charging;

I came here after Elon Musk destroyed Twitter, and find it a far better experience.;
Takes a bit of getting use to, but it is way better than T.....r or x;
üòç üòç üòç üòç;
While it had a lot of initial interest, I'm weary of how bad the ads are going to be if Facebook is any indication. It lacks a lot of personalization options like colors, font sizes, banner images, or other settings available in competitors like Xwitter, but is at least stable and easy to navigate. Definitely a more complete experience using the app than trying to use the web verson.;
You need threads it's a must have!;
Emoo üñ§;
Needs Improvement. Just having followers and following isn't enough. When you open someone's profile if we are following each other, we should be able to see 'follows you' (the person following me) and following signifying I'm following the person.;
it's a fun place to post random thoughts, but it has limited features: you can post images, videos, or text and you can see other posts and recommended account's posts, but that's it. if there was more to do it would be better, but I still like it!;
I really really love this app, but am disappointed with one thing, you can't chat privately....;
dull content. confusing timeline. no hashtags to foster community during bonding events such as GP races or even elections. It's the Lada Niva of social media apps. You'll get from A to B, but you're not sure how, and no one will want to come with you.;
Had to delete. The app messed up my Instagram. Now I can't upload photos to IG. This happened after I tried to add a story from Threads and add to Instagram at the same time. Now everytime I try to add a picture to IG stories,reels or feed is says error or unable to save image. Even after I cleared cache, cleared data, uninstall and re installed IG. Wish I never added Threads;
I'm on Threads all the time now, I'm barely on Instagram anymore. I love the community!;
Nice;
I hope you have some real time speech like Twitter.;
Confused permeable;

I love that you can post text, photos, or videos. You can enhance your connection with your followers with every thread you post. All that's missing for me is a DM section. Hope we get that soon.;

Work in progress. Really needs to rediscover that early momentum if it's going to become the new Twitter, especially if Musk introduces a fee for his battered toy.;
Nice üëç;
It's like Twitter, but less dumb and less racist.;
On Instagram, I can choose the option of using dark mode. Why can't I do that with this app?;
This app is very important in Instagram;
A little feedback here, you should give the option to post publicly or just to close friends kind of like on Instagram. I know twitter has posting to circle option. It would be nice to have. I spoke too soon. Twitter is getting rid of circles so maybe it's your chance to add the close friends option and get more ppl over here. Add it.;
I don't like this app. But that's just my personal preference. I feel like all of social media isn't what it used to be.;
still some way to go but it's a much better place than X;
Excellent, need verification too;
Please add the private Message Button button üîò nd hashtags feature as well .;
Update: the new search functionality makes it a much better app. It's developing well and needs a few more upgrades to hit 5/5.;
It's getting there feature by feature. Still better than Xitter.;

Not sure;
better then twitter/X at this point less drama and can't stand the toxicity on Twitter. Definitely would recommend threads and facebook at this point. Even though some things threads lacks it will get there;
It has a future. Might be the competitor that can take down the prominent site but it needs more features and adjustment to be marketable.;

Meta would block all your accounts without giving any reason. Support unreachable. Data gone. Better avoid using any Meta products.;

Does not yet have the all the features of X us users liked....but its getting there. So come on in....the waters lovely and its really friendly;

Advantages of peer to peer interaction, and communication associations between us is great, but I feel it could be too complicated to sustain in the future.

"all this app ever does is CRASH & even when it's ""functional"", it's essentially useless without being able to search for relevant content! since the #1 best thing about TWITTER is the ability to search for every tweet ever containing specific keywords & within a certain time period, it's ridiculous that no other social media platform has included that same thorough method ~yet.. tho many still at least use hashtags lol but not Threads! couldn't even include THAT before going live, really? sigh..";
The link between accounts means if Meta's flawed automated systems find one of your accounts problematic they throttle you across the board. Way too much effort to figure out what is and isn't going to raise their flags, and it's impossible to properly appeal things when it gets it wrong. The sheer volume of posts Instagram flagged as sexually inappropriate when it's literally just a shirtless man. And then the linked threads account becomes a void you scream into. Too much drama.;

Great app so far. I strongly suggest adding an explore page as well as having the for you front page, and maybe fixing hashtags on Instagram and implementing them here too.;
good app;
Although it can use a few new features and upgrades, I like Threads and I believe it will improve with greatness over time. People say Threads can't compete with X, but that's not what I feel. I believe Threads will thrive and blossom on its own.;
it is good but it's missing more people;

Blocking Canadian content. Uninstalled. Never really used it much anyways. Twitter wasn't that great, and now it's dead. Threads is just like how Twitter was, but there's no desktop browser app, so that makes it worse imo.;
very nice app;
This app is great, but like Twitter, please add the impression item next to the posts we make so that I can see how many views and impressions each post has received, except for likes and comments. This is really effective and gives more motivation to users to increase their activity time in this program and attract more audience to it. Be sure to do the new update so that you have helped both users and your application a lot ‚ô•Ô∏è;

not adding interesting features fast enough, they could seriously capitalize on the insta & threads surface area with new interesting ways to interact with homies but it kinda just isn't hitting and I hope they can turn this project around. you also need way more tools and info so creators can still feel confident they will have an audience otherwise they will never stop using X and their followers will also never stop using X thanks for coming to my Ted talk;

I am getting notifications that I never consented for that someone has made a new post on threads and I cannot simply turn the notifications off. It rather prompts me to this page. I regret making a stupid account here. üôÉ;

I tried to post a joke and it told me it was too similar to posts that had been flagged. I can't post vulgar hilarious jokes? Why would I even be here?;

I don't fine this app useful, yes it's so user-centered, but this is incomparable to how Twitter made some informative features such as Trends, community, and the most unbeatable one: tweets searching is available. Meanwhile Threads, so far, is not providing us useful information from other users especially if we only have small number of followings and For You page is not even helpful to discover our likings, which is not how I expected it to be.;

Threads seems to be the most reliable way to comment on actual conversations.;
"It's pretty glitchy, not going to lie. I'm going to uninstall it for now because it keeps saying ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try again later"" no matter what i did, it just would not work, so I can't even use it anyways, what the point of using up storage space. I like the idea though, it's just too early.

The developers have already said that this app is a work in progress. Let's hope it gets better than Twitter and simplifies text based posts. At the current stage, the user interface is easy and beautiful. A lot of famous Twitter profiles have already moved to Threads, so it's not lonely here. The biggest issue is that you see posts from accounts that you never followed! It's very very annoying. Apart from that, this app should integrate WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram in one place.;
it's good, but there are a few glitches that need attention.;

Nice Working app thank you for threads an Instagram Fimaly ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè;
as a Twitter type app (post pictures and videos) is okay but only as interesting as the people you follow.;
awesome;
Ok;
So far I like it! It's very basic and I'm kinda disappointed at the lack of accessibility options such as being able to add alt text but... Overall it has a nostalgic vibe like when social media used to be fun, at least it is for me. Interested to see how it progresses. Update - we have alt text now!;
This app needs one thing: Post Editing. That would set it apart from Twitter.;
Summa ethipathen nalla irukku;
I like this one;
no pinning no hashtags;
In it's infancy but so much more reliable than Twitter which is now a dumpster fire rolling down a hill crashing into every parked car along the way. Dark theme is beautiful and the photo carousel is beautiful. Missing embedded YouTube videos though.;
still have a lot to improve, we don't know what's working and what's not working... so far X is still better than threads by far;
At this stage in the app's development, gifs, vids & pics work, but hashtags don't. There's also no translation function. Those are both big problems because they limit how much I can interact with different groups that interest me.;
it's okay. it's not bad, but it needs work.;
good;
you can't post new threads anymore;
This is nice app and also same Instagram thanks;

Give u just one suggestion....pls make a like by double tap on images.;
Awful;
would give this a higher rating if there was more features that every social media have like hashtags. being able to change user without logging out. beyond that it's already better than X. thank you for giving us a place to go to without getting overrun with bots and scammers.;

For the past 16 hours, Threads has not been working. Unable to update my home feed. Unable to post. Unable to reply. Full internet connection and every other app on my phone works fine. I've been patiently waiting months for basic features to be added, but as of now it's not even functional. Clearly, Meta is not my choice to replace Twixxer as my app of choice for current events. Should have known Zuckerbergs latest would fail to live up to expectations. Deleted app Oct 5th 2023;

It is ok but growth and engagement is just bad as Instagram. It is faster, easier and less clunky though. Not being able to put the threads link back on your Instagram profile is rather backwards.;
Only as successful if people actively engage. But needs active hashtags and useful use of lists to streamline threads brought to us.;

Usable. It's ok. Edit: it's way better than Twitter, I meant X, it doesn't as complex as X, better layout/interfaces, it looks better! It doesn't show comments that I hearted! Love it. Need a feature that filters out the post I don't wanna see, like I can hide post with words that I don't like.;
If I wanted Twitter style news feeds, I'd install Twitter. Why did you have to screw IG up with this nonsense. I hope it fails.;

Twitter is cringe. Facebook is cringe. so Facebook makes a knock off Twitter that's more cringe than both, with less features than both. I wasn't going to leave a review, but after deleting the app, Instagram is now showing me threads from randoms that I never even followed. shows how desperate they are lol.;
Not as good as twitter .;
Absolute WASTE of an app. If you don't already have a huge following on IG literally no one will see your posts. There's no reward for posting. This app failed to produce dopamine and therefore I cannot become addicted to it. That's a failed social media if I've ever seen one. Plus they refuse to listen to what people want added, of course. Such a gigantic waste of time. Huge let-down. Meta disappoints yet again.;

Missing Video Scrubbing This app isn't as mature as Twitter/X yet. But it is acceptable. Other than not being able to scrub through videos, the app has almost everything you need.

Palestine is free today, tomorrow, or even after hundreds of years. We will not remain silent regarding the clear bias towards Israel. Palestine is our cause and the cause of every free and rational human being who thinks properly. Palestine will not be annihilated and will remain forever. We will deter the Zionist entity.;

this app has been so positive! New updates have made it almost perfect!;

Being in the Meta Community, these apps are trying to silence anyone talking about the genocide & crimes committed in P@l3st!ne by Is rael.

In our life every day we live with thread .whether it is life-thread or cloth thread .But to get it polished and make it a habit in our life need lot of hard work and dedication and we need to start accepting the situation .If our thread has a weakness our life button will start slipping away from us.

"TL;DR Better Twitter, No idiocy is allowed here. 9/10, 5* Only on Threads can you find those dippy-doos from Twitter getting sauteed to perfection for being in Cult45, and beyond. It is not a safe space, but this space is safe for you to be you, and you will not be without friends. It's even got better community guidelines, and posts do actually get REVIEWED by a HUMAN, if not initially screened by one. Also, followers and following folk feels so much better, and engagement is thought-provoking.";
