What I liked the most was the dark theme that it came with upon opening the app. Easy to get used to.;Satisfaction
Here's my honest review: It's not a bad app, but there could be more features alike that could make the whole app more fun to use. Much like how Instagram allows you to switch accounts, maybe Threads could use the same feature. The only method to switching is by logging out currently. ;Error
This app is perfect for understanding your point of view;Satisfaction
This app is garbage, collects highly personal data that is unnecessary. Tried this out it sucks deleting it now.;Satisfaction
Why does it want my personal data? So they can sell it to businesses and profit off my personal information? No thanks. Uninstall;Satisfaction
good concept, UI is great, user experience is okay;Satisfaction
"App is clearly not ready for release. Integration with Instagram is great; however, the biggest letdown is having the home feed being filled with randos, with no way to make it only people I follow. I'm patiently waiting for this issue to improve.";Error
Constant crashing when trying to upload most photos, although there doesn't seem to be a pattern of image size or resolution, which causes it to crash or simply fail to upload.

I think this is the best app for Twitter;Satisfaction
It's an app that violates every thing about privacy, worst idea ever from Instagram;Satisfaction
Need to improve media support. You cannot copy-paste images/gif via clipboard. Every time need to import it from attachments icon. Voice for videos is not working as well. So this Zuckerberg's tantrum trying to copy Musk just like he copied myspace. Why can't he be original?...;Error
Just a dumber version of twitter. Can't be even called twitter lite. And just like all Facebook apps, it's censorship pron and also say goodbye to your privacy.;Satisfaction

Excellent app my first experience on that, so it is exceptional it great then twitter;Satisfaction
Broken application. Sometimes some message disappears. App has been removed;Error
Fantastic app thanks Mark Zuckerberg;Satisfaction
Huge network problem;Error
I am unable to login or sign up.. Because I don't like Instagram so I don't have an account on it that's why on threads I can't even sign up that's totally wrong when you're launching a new app you should have at least that much sense to take non-Instagram users on your platform or allow them to use it;Satisfaction
Threads need some translation cause being an international kpop fan is so hard when there's no translations;Error
Threads doesn't work properly on Vivo device screen is spread and got stuck please fix this issue...and please make it Android 9 version;Error
It's really cool, especially in the first version, it also be cool that when we scroll up, see the app icon to tap it and get a better reflesh action;Satisfaction
Excellent alternative;Satisfaction
I just know that for threads to work properly it will take a couple of years. Cause it took twitter a long time. And also if you delete the app it deletes your Instagram account;Satisfaction
I just installed and then uninstalled, totally wasted, if you don't have any Instagram account, you can't login in threads, and we all know that Instagram is a su*ks.;Satisfaction

Amazing this app;Satisfaction
chat option available in threads app;Error
It's a wonderful app ‚ù§Ô∏è‚úÖ;Satisfaction
A great app given the fact it's only been a few days since it launched but there are obviously some flaws in it. For example, when I want to post a picture, it often kicks me out of the app and takes hours for it to allow me to post that picture. I also usually can't see who just started following me, shows me my followers fine at first but once I surpass 50-ish followers, I stop receiving notifications and I can no longer see the usernames of those who follow me.;Error
Too much loading I'm still waiting very bad app;Error
I downloaded the app it was all fine... I connected it to my insta account but as soon as I started scrolling it got hanged and something weird was happening like the app was having some bug... Plzz fix it..;Error
Too good liked the AI and UI of the app ü§Ø Instagram connection is a great way to enhance the use of both apps. Great reach with least marketing. Happy threading.;Satisfaction
I wanna like the app, but it keeps crashing every time I try to post a photo;Error
I like it;Satisfaction
Worst experience as it is not opening even at least for 2 times I have uninstalled it still not working and now I have uninstalled it;Error
Very nice app, but its missing a few things such as switching accounts, hashtags, taking pictures, etc. Its very smooth and well optimized, unlike instagram for Android which is ironic;Error
Faul app, not closed to Twitter;Satisfaction
If I don't have / want an Instagram account so I can't login, that's not acceptable. I am uninstalling the app.;Satisfaction
We need an organized feed that doesn't lose position everytime we move from it. Have it at least load a certain number of threads that will be shown next when we drag down to refresh the feed and so on. Such a basic feature;Error
Worst aap when I'm opening this app it's getting close √∞≈∏¬§¬¶√∞≈∏¬è¬ª‚Äç√¢‚Ñ¢‚Ç¨√Ø¬∏¬è√∞≈∏¬§¬∑√∞≈∏¬è¬ª‚Äç√¢‚Ñ¢‚Ç¨√Ø¬∏¬è√∞≈∏¬§¬∑√∞≈∏¬è¬ª‚Äç√¢‚Ñ¢‚Ç¨√Ø¬∏¬è√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨;Error
lemme explain what scam this is, It will not deactivate even if you deactivate. also, when u want to delete that stupid badge on instagram page, it will appear tone after time after timeeeeee!!!!;Error
This app could use a free mode, like FB you know;Satisfaction
It's been glitching ever since I've downloaded it;Error
If I wanted to be on a subpar app where disinfo was not being flagged and allowed to run rampant, I'd just stay on twitter.;Error
This app is far better than Twitter ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ** Writing this down so that mfs from insta don't join twitter **;Satisfaction
The App crashes again and again, think the developer for to give it the testing team, and push it to live. I'll download the next public release.;Error
It actually has a lot of bugs! Thread team should fix the bug first before it launched!;Error
I can't find follow requests sent to me in the ‚ù§ section. It was there but then disappeared? I am very disappointed with it;Error
Crashes when uploading pics;Error
I had Awesome Experience using, User Interface is simple, No Fake Accounts, Bots Trolls etc.. like on Twitter hope this app will Replace Twitter and Be A Better Alternative.;Satisfaction
I think it's a really nice app üëçüèΩüòÉ;Satisfaction
Unable to upload 4 pictures;Error
I wish there is a chat option in threads too, so that we are able to share threads with one another on the same platform instead of copying the link and sharing it on instagram. Also, it would be better if we are able to download the video or the picture directly. I personally feel that maybe threads should be a part of instagram instead of being a complete separate app.. Just like how reels are a part, threads should also be a part of instagram. That would be nice and easier.;Satisfaction
Not bad so far;Satisfaction
So far so good.;Satisfaction
The app was using about 99% of my battery. Deleted it and my battery was working normal.;Error
Meh, I'm on the fence about it. I know it's new but it has a bunch of things that needs fixing. The timeline, if that's what it's called, needs to show stuff from who I follow, not everyone. I'll check the replies for those comments. Need a dark mode option and ability to make fonts BIGGER and maybe a bold option as well. Also a definite need is when you open the app or refresh the thread, don't go all the way to the top. Keep the thread where I left off, thanks.;Error
useless, can't even change name or username other than Instagram.;Error
Great app really but highly addictive (send help);Satisfaction
Requires stupid amount of permissions, can't delete account, and looks awful. It's a very disorganized mess.;Error
This app is recommendable for fast com.;Satisfaction
AWFUL, TWITTER BETTER;Satisfaction
This app is a privacy nightmare, collects all of your data and worst of all it's owned by Facebook;Satisfaction
It's definitely cool;Satisfaction
Great app;Satisfaction
For an app that just launched a few days ago, it's honestly pretty good!! However, there are a few things I'd like to see improved & made: hashtags, folder to save threads, draft notes.;Satisfaction
Nice competitor of Twitter;Satisfaction
Needs more features;Satisfaction
Twitter was so much better than it.;Satisfaction
Hi dev team I downloaded this app, and I have been trying to login with ig as requested but it always fails saying there's a problem trying to be fixed. What's the problem?;Error
We can't text in the app;Error
Collects way too much data;Satisfaction
Ok, first of all, many things are missing in this app. We need a poll option, we need to be properly able to share links, and a lot more gimmicky stuff is missing. Please add them ASAP;Error
Always keeps crashing when I am trying to upload something;Error
Very trash app twitter is 1000X better get free speech then we can talk;Satisfaction
So far so good;Satisfaction
Please work on the sounds, there are no sounds for notification on Threads. Also, we can't message privately;Error
A very good App;Satisfaction
While it's still adding features, sure, it's not MuskTwitter and it's pretty close to the old twitter, so enjoy!;Satisfaction
For a just starting app, it's surprisingly good. Like astonishingly so.;Satisfaction
Such a cozy platform visually, in my opinion. Just cannot scroll through my notifications.... can y'all fix it that?;Error
Something is wrong with this app, cause it's not working on my phone at all. It's just cloning pages like hundreds and thousands;Error
Not as good as Twitter it's similar to Instagram;Satisfaction
Ugh, Mr. Zuck collects too much personal data with this app. Let alone all the political bias on his platforms. Stay away!;Satisfaction
As a developer and a normal user, the app is really easy to navigate through and also has a simple ui.;Satisfaction
App is not working properly it is stuck in The middle;Error
Nothing is interesting in the app. I was expecting something new;Satisfaction
Add a separate feed just for subscriptions and let us choose a general feed by interests or hashtags. i mean, the adds are fine, but not the whole messy feed.;Error
First of all I like this app. that it's an amazing app.;Satisfaction
But this app is not working properly on my device maybe it's because of my old device. It's glitching, overlapping subrato pages in one page, etc.  ;Error
Threads is such a fun app but yes it can do with a few improvements, but for myself it's perfect the way it is. It's definitely a goodbye to Twitter from me √∞≈∏Àú¬Å;Satisfaction
i think THIS i's better for Twitter every body yous it this amazing apps;Satisfaction
Does not work!;Error
I wanna give them a 5star but they've gotta make an option where we can make dm, like everything is literally public √∞≈∏¬•¬∞√∞≈∏¬•¬∞√∞≈∏¬•¬∞ WITH ALL SAID, I'M ALREADY ADDICTED HAHA;Satisfaction
A torrent of meaningless celebrity spam and random posts from people I've never met.;Error
Needs a lot of work in my opinion. Not getting notifications when those I follow post, all notifications are on, still nothing. Would love it if those I do follow are 1st on my feed. Also, a translate option would be great as I follow non English speaking celebs and have to screenshot posts for translation.;Error
garbage ui, cant post images due to errors.... more r&d needed if you wanna rip off twitter successfully...;Error
I keep getting errors when trying to post images.;Error
Honestly, I haven't had many issues. I do want to see more functionality on this app. ;Error
Very bad UI.;Error
My insta keeps crashing ever since i joined threads;Error
Lots of bug;Error
I literally just installed this app and it won't even let me open it. It says the app is updating right now to try again later. How is the app updating if I literally just downloaded it?;Error
Multiple accounts need to be included. Some of us have multiple Instagram accounts.;Error
You can't delete your account without also deleting your Instagram account. Don't sign up, it's not worth it.;Error
It's the worst parts of Twitter combined with the worst parts of Facebook;Satisfaction
Needs more features. You can't search posts. You can't use Hashtags. If you have a lot of Instagram followers, then chances are you'll have threads followers. Otherwise, there's no other way to get followers on here. I hope that you develop this app furthermore.;Error
Nice app √¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è;Satisfaction
i can't even download the app, keep taking my data, downloads still 100 but never installs so terrible;Error
Better than Twitter already;Satisfaction
Love this app;Satisfaction
Useless pale copy of Twitter without soul and no fun and tremendous use of data. Pointless.;Satisfaction
cheater! Why can't we delete this account without deleting our Instagram, trash company,;Satisfaction
there's a glitch in the app;Error
Best App;Satisfaction
Fix the algorithm first. I don't want to see those verified accounts on my timeline;Error
worst social network ever;Satisfaction
This is the most amazing app in the world. I saw it on Facebook today;Satisfaction
Not good, it requires an Instagram account, totally unsafe, your public opinion linked to your cellphone number, your personal information made public.;Satisfaction
I think it is great but some features need to be advanced. First the photo loading time is still slow, secondly I suggest that all Meta Apps could be synced inform of tab/browser where you can switch platforms easily. For example if you are in threads you can have switchable icons or tabs to navigate to Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and vice versa. Fourthly, there should be filters through which people could determine thematic areas of interest including themes, topics, personalities, etc;Error
A twitter alternative for intolerant leftists who can't cope with conservative opinions and want them censored.;Satisfaction
We need features here.... Thread Groups or Pages Maybe direct messages Hashtags Translations Reactions (like, haha, love, care, angry, wow, etc);Satisfaction
I can't delete my account, they have tricked the users. And I can't even remove the badge from my Instagram account. It's like they are forcing to use this application. Losers, come up with your own ideas, stop stealing and copy pasting stuffs.;Error
Please don't put the letter's counting this is not good I wanna talk too much and express my feelings freely please solve this and let us be free in what we want to say ..;Satisfaction
Don't have an Instagram account and was no prompt to just make an account for this app. Maybe they'll figure it out later but currently useless app for me;Error
Great app twitter rival and a good one I used it on the first day of its release liked it. Mr musk is making twitter limited and pay for blue tick is very bad. Money can't buy everything. Hope this app will stay and more and more people come on this and this app should not follow the steps of musk and FB ads factory and keep our data save. Good luck treads.;Satisfaction
A wonderful and new application, but it is similar to Twitter, the only difference is that it is owned by Meta;Satisfaction
wasted many hours downloading this app yesterday. Once I went near Instagram my Threads information was not locatable;Error
App crashes upon trying to post content just another poorly executed copycat from zuck himself;Error
If you don't have an Instagram account already, you cannot even login to this app! There is no option to create an account here. Uninstalled.;Error
Worthless app for now. Created out of spite for another website, you know the one. Will update if it ever gets better.;Satisfaction
Can't post. Whenever I try to make a post the app crashes;Error
The app is still new and I have installed the app for the first time. The setup was easy to do.;Satisfaction
The app is good;Satisfaction
Trash app. Had to sign up twice and still getting banned or under review after I have written the code on a paper received through my email and phone and also took a selfie. Like damn what else is there for a new user to verify lmao. Meta is a sensitive weakarse company who will never be better than twitter. Update: threads finally let me sign up and verification completed. I hope they don't piss others off but I give them 4 stars. Minus 1 star for pissing me off in the beginning.;Error
Doesn't refresh √∞≈∏Àú‚Ä¢ stays on the same thing √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö;Error
Worst app total copy paste;Satisfaction
Very boring a bad and poor copy of Twitter.;Satisfaction
Too much data collection, censorship, and ownership of images. Zuckerberg don't need anymore apps. His companies phony fact checks to control the narrative is unreal and the extreme censorship of speech. I'll stick with twitter thanks.;Satisfaction
Doesn't work with me I wanted to try it but it doesn't work for me I get the idea of competitive marketing, but making it this aggressive and making me have to delete my linked Instagram to threads. U get one star;Satisfaction
The app was okay for the first couple of days and then all my verified accounts and political nonsense. Not even two days and it's turned into Twitter pre-2022.;Satisfaction
Need to be able to only see people I follow in my feed, there's too many accounts I don't care to see.;Error
The app is nice;Satisfaction
Threads seems to be the reason why my Instagram has stopped working. As for threads itself, I can't see the replies I'm getting. As soon as I have IG back I'm uninstall the whole lot. The functionality is just terrible.;Error
Wao nice app;Satisfaction
A horrible clone of Twitter abundant with censorship and data collection.;Satisfaction
Too many privacy concerns;Satisfaction
Nice app;Satisfaction
I like it. But it needs improvements: 1. Please add the Options to choose pics from another folder. Its so hard to find it just to scroll down all the way. 2. Add the login option for IG lite user like me. This app is good right now especially I can post longer messages, (of course it's name is thread hehe). Good job Meta √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏¬è¬ª;Error
You can't use keywords to search for topics, big negative for me but I am looking forward to seeing the development process;Error
A fair warning: using this app gives Facebook the right to all your data, and you can't delete the account without deleting your Instagram account. Aside from that issue, there is so much basic functionality missing. How did Facebook (Meta) ever greenlight this app?;Error
My app is not running clearly;Error
Better than Twitter;Satisfaction
Weird and cool luv it;Satisfaction
I'm loving the App;Satisfaction
Why you can't save pics on the App like Twitter or post any nudes on the App We need these issues fix;Error
Good apps and easy use;Satisfaction
The app treats people like a product and not a person. Taking your every detail including your personal health information... No wonder it can't show its face in the EU. √∞≈∏¬§¬¶√∞≈∏¬è¬æ;Satisfaction
This app don't work well at all on my phone;Error
Needs more functionality to compete with other social platforms like direct messaging and searching for anything other than accounts. Currently, the app is down for many people and there is no logic to why it went down. That is surprising and disappointing for such a big corporation already rooted in social media like Meta.;Satisfaction
I want to post a pic but it auto exits.;Error
I have a problem with the app;Error
Best app;Satisfaction
Extremely bad app. Has been screen lag from last 3 days and tried many times to fix it by redownloading the app but still doesn't work. Extremely worst experience.;Error
Why does this app need so many permissions? I permanently deleted Facebook from my phone because somebody told me that I was online, but I did not open the app that day. Why would this app need biometrics and reroute phone calls and reorder running apps and see your health fitness and what other apps you have and activities you're doing and all of that?? Never going to use a meta app again;Satisfaction
I really love this... At least there's another room for opportunity... Twitter ads are cost. And getting engagement could be difficult.... But welcome THREAD....;Satisfaction
App crashes every time I attach a photo.;Error
Getting crashed for no reason..;Error
Buggy login experience but now I'm in. Much better platform than Twitter or Reddit at this point.;Error
BEST APPS I HAVE SEEN EVER.;Satisfaction
You're completely locked in if you sign up. No deleting your account unless you wanna lose your Instagram too. Not to mention your fyp is covered in posts by people you don't even follow;Error
It's not working;Error
It cool;Satisfaction
I would learn, like, love from my thread.;Satisfaction
I want to express my appreciation for threads√¢≈ì¬®;Satisfaction
Bad app;Satisfaction
Amazing app loved it would have given it 6 stars if it was possible;Satisfaction
Trash. It's a tracking app. Do not download;Satisfaction
Very good app;Satisfaction
Great app with a lot of potential! ;Satisfaction
However, there is a lot that needs to be fixed. For example, the option to mute accounts is lagging/delayed. This feature is definitely needed at this stage, which is part of the next problem. Another issue I've noticed is the home page shows a lot of accounts I don't follow and have never heard of, and a lot of blue check accounts that I don't want to see. There is no way to filter them out to see the content I actually want, from people I follow.;Error
Excellent app;Satisfaction
It provides a good experience to build something meaningful.;Satisfaction
Visual bug can't even use to scroll list;Error
This app seems pretty good so far, but I have noticed that any post notifications have been a day late in being delivered!;Error
Not useful;Satisfaction
Glitch in the Matrix!;Error
It's pretty decent;Satisfaction
I'm having problems with my notifications. I get the notifications VERY late, sometimes DAYS later.;Error
Nice app;Satisfaction
Terrible app. Can't create a new account.;Error
That is Twitter lite version;Satisfaction
Best APK √∞≈∏¬§≈æ;Satisfaction
Making my personal Instagram account crashed;Error
Great start. Now keep updating it please.;Satisfaction
"Looks stable on Android so far. Please add an option to disable ""Autoplay"" function for videos.";Error
Terrible experience. Just use Mastodon directly.;Error
Trashy basic UI. It looks like they shipped it early just to take advantage of Twitter being down;Error
One problem is facing no one liking the post;Error
UI is not coming properly. It's blurry can't read anything. So, please help me to fix it asap;Error
This app is not enough. I didn't like it. Because if we log in this app we will be stuck. If you log out from this, you will be logged out from Instagram. You should find a solution for this as soon as possible.;Error
Not happy at all. Do we really need to deactivate our Instagram profile to get rid of the Thread profile? Disappointed.;Satisfaction
Pretty much excellent start but I wish there was a minor option to just view the threads from users I'm following instead of everybody. Also, there is no current way to search for a particular thread.;Error
"Cannot save pictures & crashes posting pics! Twitter allows you to save any picture; Threads blocks downloads. On Twitter, I can easily post a picture; Threads crashes if I try to post a picture. Ridiculous! So far, this has been a pretty miserable app! I hope they fix it soon.";Error
Their ii so glitch;Error
The app invades users' privacy by abusing the public's lack of attention. I would like to delete my Threads account but for that, I need to delete the Instagram account, forcing users to continue using that app. This is completely ridiculous, you could have done better.;Satisfaction
Such an amazing app, nice algorithm;Satisfaction
This app is so amazing and fulfills all the requirements;Satisfaction
My Instagram account was hacked after logging into Threads;Error
Could use a change of theme;Error
App is glitch, everything is mashed up together. Unusable;Error
Its an amazing app;Satisfaction
Not working properly;Error
I can't upload photos or videos. Every time I write a caption, the application immediately exits suddenly, why?;Error
Good social app;Satisfaction
It's trash.;Satisfaction
Very nice app √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç;Satisfaction

Very useful app √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç thanks insta for gifting this type of app√¢‚Ñ¢¬•√Ø¬∏¬è√¢‚Ñ¢¬•√Ø¬∏¬è;Satisfaction
Much better than Twitter;Satisfaction
It is a very good app, it's a better app than Twitter;Satisfaction
there is a small problem, if we delete it when we don't need it, our Instagram account will also be deleted.;Error
Always very nice;Satisfaction
Problem1 : WHERE IS THE FOLLOWING TAB?? Problem2 : when I type in a text, and it lengthens , the text doesn't scroll up. Instead it gets covered underneath the on screen keyboard I'm typing on making it impossible for me to view the text while I'm typing it. Desired features : those 5 reaction from Facebook next to the standard Heart Like. And the no. Of views on a threads like Twitter has.;Error
So far, so good. Simple and easy to use!;Satisfaction
This is great I recomend it to everybody;Satisfaction
Cant upload an image says failed to upload thread if i try to add an image;Error
App has way too many phone permissions. No way to turn off or delete without removing Instagram.;Error
I can't even use it properly. When I started to scroll or at least go to the other tabs it started to glitch and overlaps everything. Please fix this bug in the next update, I can't have the same experience like what my other friends does.;Error
There are a lot of glitches.. Whenever I'm trying to touch the screen it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s being overlapped..;Error
Not useful ,just a copy of another app√∞≈∏‚Äò≈Ω√∞≈∏‚Äò≈Ω;Satisfaction

Today after 6 to 7 hours of installing the app got closed till now it is showing try again. I uninstalled.;Error
It keeps bugging;Error
Very basic and poorly interface;Error
What's the point of following people if their posts never actually show up on your home tab? Instead all I see is random people posting about how much they like Threads, so it really just looks like the app is trying to make itself look good without actually doing anything useful.;Error
Please do something. The app is not working. This app is horrible √∞≈∏Àú‚Äù;Error

Very amazing and wonderful √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç;Satisfaction
I signed up with Instagram and then installed threads. In Threads, I muted several posters. I did not post in either app. but, a warning popped up that I had violated Community standards. currently apparently disagreeing with the algorithm is a violation of community. if I wanted complete lack of control I would go back to Twitter.;Error
Better than Twitter;Satisfaction
Boring;Satisfaction
This is very awesome √¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è love it;Satisfaction
The app is a very big crash, full of bugs, but it's good to see Instagram is trying something new fantastic keep it up;Error
Lovely √∞≈∏‚ÄòÀÜ√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√∞≈∏‚Äò≈íapp;Satisfaction

Crashes too often;Error
Crashed at least 30 times, every time I try to upload a picture it stops.;Error
Big like;Satisfaction

Very good threads aap;Satisfaction
Very good application;Satisfaction
Nice app. Is it so cute then Twitter??????;Satisfaction
I want to like it. But it only lets me post pics for one day before going back to crashing every time I try....;Error
Best;Satisfaction
Nice app;Satisfaction
I'm loving the app, the only fix I want apart from bug fixes is some control/filter over what we see on our feed. I don't even see the threads by people I follow, and don't wanna see random lame meme pages.;Error
Buggy;Error
I can't post a picture, why??;Error
Nice app for usage;Satisfaction
I love this app √¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è (√¢¬Å¬†√£∆í¬ª√¢¬Å¬†√¢ÀÜ‚Ç¨√¢¬Å¬†√£∆í¬ª√¢¬Å¬†);Satisfaction
Wow nice app√∞≈∏‚Äù¬•;Satisfaction
It is a good app and overall good concept but I guess it is better if u add chat option and stories with the new updates. This is just the beginning. I hope we will see good later;Satisfaction
Great app√∞≈∏¬•¬∞;Satisfaction
Overlapping and is threads working in the Android version;Error
Amazing;Satisfaction
Downloaded after not working Instagram properly, anyone facing the same problem?;Error
Great to use;Satisfaction
Perfect;Satisfaction
Nice √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç beautiful;Satisfaction
Algorithm for the feed needs a lot of work. I'm seeing the same threads day after day at the top of my feed even if I've seen them half a dozen times already. A lot of random junk I don't care about.;Error
My Instagram video not playing when I installed √∞≈∏Àú¬°√∞≈∏Àú¬°;Error
Hot garbage;Satisfaction
Very dead application not working properly.√¢Àú¬π√Ø¬∏¬è√¢Àú¬π√Ø¬∏¬è√∞≈∏Àú √∞≈∏Àú¬†√∞≈∏Àú¬°;Error
Not working on Redmi note 6 pro. Overlapping text issues on scroll.;Error
Literally insane! A good competitor to √∞≈∏¬ê¬¶ :);Satisfaction
though it would be nice to be able to choose the photos from their folder instead of scrolling all the way down just to post it in the app;Error
So far so good, the app is easy to use;Satisfaction
I say only, it's a very nice app Thanks META;Satisfaction
While uploading photos, it keeps getting kicked out of the app, shows that the photos are not coming in the form of files or positions, all of them come together, so many problems are faced.;Error
Wow good app√¢‚Ñ¢¬•√Ø¬∏¬è;Satisfaction
Wayy better community and content than its competitor (Twitter);Satisfaction
Easy to handle, easy to use;Satisfaction
Didn't even load on my Android device.;Error
Better than Twitter.;Satisfaction
It's clearly rolled out in haste, but I appreciate the people who worked on this app. There is no method to add more than one profile which we can toggle between on Instagram. So if we have 2 profiles on Instagram, u can only use one. Hope this will be resolved soon.;Error
Best platform;Satisfaction
Super app;Satisfaction
This is not a high-quality app. In this, the post of useless people comes to your home without calling you, picture editing facility is also not available in this.;Error
Worst app;Satisfaction
Fix the bugs it's been days and I am not being able to use it;Error
Not optimized for phones with smaller screens.;Error
Best app;Satisfaction
1 star because my feed is full of suggested rubbish that I don't want to see just like Facebook and Instagram. I should only see posts from people I follow. I'm sick of Meta throwing complete nonsense onto our newsfeeds;Error
My tread having bug/glitch this is why my thread doesn't work anyway so please check it out and repair it! My Instagram I'd :- abuu.talibb;Error
Features requests & bugs (so far): - notification scrolling is very limited - only full gallery is available when looking for a file to attach - no ability to just switch accounts (you have to log out every time) - no dark mode (please for the love of my retinas!);Error
Wow lovely √∞≈∏≈í¬π;Satisfaction
Very bad;Satisfaction
Booooring!!!;Satisfaction
Why I am having a bug?;Error
works very smoothly √¢Àú¬∫√Ø¬∏¬è√∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç well-done!;Error
Excellent app;Satisfaction
The app scrolls slowly and does not work properly in dark mode;Error
Unusable mess, literally cannot read/see anything because of a bug;Error
Better app from Twitter √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö√∞≈∏Àú‚Äö;Satisfaction
Easy to Use and better than Twitter I love this app;Satisfaction
Glitched, and choppy;Error
Threads crashed on my phone;Error
Worst app;Satisfaction
Very nice √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏‚Ñ¢‚Äö;Satisfaction
Worst app, √∞≈∏Àú¬≠ fully glitched screen.;Error
It's too bad. It's not working. I don't want to rate it at all;Error
When I upload images, the app crashes;Error
Awesome, helpful app. Better than Twitter;Satisfaction
"here no option to ""PHOTOS""√∞≈∏‚Äì¬º√Ø¬∏¬è save in the gallery.";Error
This app is good ;Error
Most informative app;Satisfaction
This is very safe, careful, and video reel & photo amazing in view app is very nice is the future and technology very nice;Satisfaction
Too good √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏¬è¬ª√∞≈∏Àú≈†;Satisfaction
Why do I see so many irrelevant threads? The feed is a huge mess;Error
Very good app bro like Twitter dad √∞≈∏¬•¬µ√∞≈∏¬•¬µ√∞≈∏¬•¬µ√¢≈ì‚Ä¶√¢≈ì‚Ä¶√¢≈ì‚Ä¶;Satisfaction
Not impressed;Satisfaction
The app pops up and bugs again√∞≈∏Àú‚Äòplease fix it!;Error
Perfect!;Satisfaction
Absolutely a very good app coz many of their accounts got hacked so it can help easily to find hackers;Satisfaction
Very bad experience √∞≈∏Àú‚Äù;Satisfaction
What the hell man, I can't use threads whenever I scroll it It just skits all the time. I can't even read it, what's written can't even see what a waste;Error
Enjoying Threads;Satisfaction
So far, it is very nice;Satisfaction
Buggy app the display is shattering;Error
Great √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç;Satisfaction
Love it;Satisfaction
Awesome √∞≈∏Àú¬ç;Satisfaction
The application will not let me create an account, And the easy log in through Google does not work.;Error
There is a screen glitch in my threads account. Try to solve the glitch (Device:- Redmi note 6 );Error
Bug fix √∞≈∏Àú‚Äú;Error
App constantly crashing when trying to comment on threads, also whenever tagging an account it just crashes straight away. Huawei P20 Pro.;Error
Wow Excellent;Satisfaction
Very nice apps;Satisfaction
It's just like Twitter I guess but the glitchiness is making it almost completely unusable. If I could upload a photo of what it looks like I would. It's headache-inducing.;Error
Won't let you log in without an Instagram account.;Error
I love this app;Satisfaction
I just tried to upload a picture captured from the camera, but this app keeps crashing.;Error
Love it;Satisfaction
Very poor app;Satisfaction
Nice features and easy to use.;Satisfaction
Good app;Satisfaction
Better Than Twitter;Satisfaction
Nice app overall;Satisfaction
Not working at all... app is crashing a lot can't see any posts;Error
This app not downloaded;Error
Well I installed the app out of curiosity and it seems interesting but whenever I open the app, it's all glitch. I'm unable to see a single word perfectly and everything is just messed up on the screen. Hope you resolve such bugs and issues soon and be able to provide a great user experience.;Error
Excellent app;Satisfaction
Real buggy. I can't even upload a photo without it crushing. Back to Twitter it is.;Error
I can't attach a photo. Once I selected from Gallery then press ok. The app keeps on crashing and just went down. Again and Again, same situation. Please fix this frustrating issue.;Error
It's good but needs more feature updates;Satisfaction
I can't post anything on threads. It just closes up. Fix it please;Error
Sometimes I can post pictures and sometimes it crashes the app. It'll be better when the bugs get worked out for a new app.;Error
Worst experience, my Instagram account logs out automatically as soon as I login to threads;Error
appens to glitch every time I enter the app√∞≈∏‚Äô‚Ç¨;Error
It's glitching every time I open the app. I hope it's fixed soon!;Error
Easy and smooth like cream;Error
The app is cool. But I couldn't access my photo folders. It's a newly launched app, so there's still room for improvement.;Error
It is not working well... it hangs...;Error
"Overall a good experience so far; however, could be improved. I have only used it for a day but the inability to properly search by topics makes me feel like I see posts that are irrelevant to me than the posts which I can relate to. It would be helpful to have hashtags available but I understand that at the moment, the app is a new launch and still has a lot of development to go through. Hopefully, we'll be able to give five stars in the future.";Error
"Worst app. Twitter is better than threads and Twitter is better optimized; it runs smoothly on my device, and on the other hand, threads are lagging a little bit on my device. Copy-paste is not the best solution, and if you try to uninstall it, your Instagram account will deactivate. I can't even DM my crush.";Error
Uploading photos is always a problem;Error
Not at all working, lots of bugs, error while using;Error
It's okay but I don't like how pictures appear... not full size of monitor width;Error
Constant app bug;Error
I love the clean interface and the lack of pointless config.;Error
However, why is my feed filled with people I don't follow??? I've tried the suggested workarounds and they don't work;Error
I love the idea but recently I've been unable to access my followers list. Keep saying I should try again. It's really hindering the smooth flow I was enjoying for the first few days.;Error
The app is great, but it keeps stopping every time I attach a picture to the thread.;Error
My home screen is just a pile of posts from accounts that I don't follow, never heard of, and don't want to see. I'm completely uninterested in all these posts. And there's no way to only see the accounts you follow--you're forced to see all the junk. Why would anyone intentionally want junk mail?;Error
This app is terrible. Nothing works correctly, even on an S23 Ultra. Very useless. Not enjoyable whatsoever;Error
"This app is annoying! I try to delete my account; you can't. I try to remove that number from my bio you can't. This is wrong. I should be able to add and delete apps if I wanted to!!!";Error
Once I open the app, it starts glitching. I have installed and uninstalled 3 times now. I can't even scroll the timeline or go to profile.;Error
Lag;Error
It's not that bad but there's a little problem in it. I want to edit my bio and import it from Instagram but it keeps saying there's something went wrong. I need help if you read this.;Error
There is no option to edit typo mistakes. I can't see where to add a video. In fact, I can't see where to add or post anything! Managed it once but don't know how? My icons seem to be missing! Using tablet and tried phone! Doesn't flow for me! I'll wait until it works properly before I invest too much time with it!;Error
Cannot even log in, just keeps coming up with error, u installed.;Error
Same poor data collection practices as other Meta apps. Battery drains much faster with this app in the background, potentially due to a larger data collection pool than other apps. Lacks lots of engaging features and currently prioritizes posts from creators established on Instagram rather than followed accounts;Error
The app works smoothly and is well-designed.;Error
App-breaking screen bug where it looks like multiple different screens are all overlaying over each other and you can't see anything. Scroll and it gets 100x worse;Error
Extremely buggy. I can't even scroll without every screen overlapping on top of each other and creating a mess.;Error
Liked it until today when it started crashing. Right now, it won't open at all.;Error
Stagnant Glitches when I scroll the page up and down;Error
