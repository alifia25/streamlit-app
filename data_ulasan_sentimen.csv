Fix the bugs issue I don't use it properly;Negative
This is a new app I hope it will be good;Positive
Beautiful apps... .;Positive
Easy to use;Positive
Hey I'm not able to post anything with pictures....Do something about it;Negative
It's so good to use such an app which is better than Twitter. Please when are you guys releasing the pc version. We can't wait for that one too.;Positive
What I liked the most was the dark theme that it came with upon opening the app. Easy to get used to.;Positive
Here's my honest review: It's not a bad app, but there could be more features alike that could make the whole app more fun to use. Much like how Instagram allows you to switch accounts, maybe Threads could use the same feature. The only method to switching is by logging out currently. ;Negative
This app is perfect for understanding your point of view;Positive
This app is garbage, collects highly personal data that is unnecessary. Tried this out it sucks deleting it now.;Negative
Why does it want my personal data? So they can sell it to businesses and profit off my personal information? No thanks. Uninstall;Negative
good concept, UI is great, user experience is okay;Positive
"App is clearly not ready for release. Integration with Instagram is great; however, the biggest letdown is having the home feed being filled with randos, with no way to make it only people I follow. I'm patiently waiting for this issue to improve.";Negative
Constant crashing when trying to upload most photos, although there doesn't seem to be a pattern of image size or resolution, which causes it to crash or simply fail to upload. I have, however, been able to upload images up to 44MP, 33MB successfully uploaded. Would like the option to clear the random rubbish from my feed without having to keep muting them!;Negative
I think this is the best app for Twitter;Positive
It's an app that violates every thing about privacy, worst idea ever from Instagram;Negative
Need to improve media support. You cannot copy-paste images/gif via clipboard. Every time need to import it from attachments icon. Voice for videos is not working as well. So this Zuckerberg's tantrum trying to copy Musk just like he copied myspace. Why can't he be original?...;Negative
Just a dumber version of twitter. Can't be even called twitter lite. And just like all Facebook apps, it's censorship pron and also say goodbye to your privacy.;Negative
Too buggy.. the screen just overlaps with its previous state and the whole screen goes bad;Negative
Excellent app my first experience on that, so it is exceptional it great then twitter;Positive
Broken application. Sometimes some message disappears. App has been removed;Negative
Fantastic app thanks Mark Zuckerberg;Positive
Huge network problem;Negative
I am unable to login or sign up.. Because I don't like Instagram so I don't have an account on it that's why on threads I can't even sign up that's totally wrong when you're launching a new app you should have at least that much sense to take non-Instagram users on your platform or allow them to use it;Negative
Threads need some translation cause being an international kpop fan is so hard when there's no translations;Negative
Threads doesn't work properly on Vivo device screen is spread and got stuck please fix this issue...and please make it Android 9 version;Negative
It's really cool, especially in the first version, it also be cool that when we scroll up, see the app icon to tap it and get a better reflesh action;Positive
Excellent alternative;Positive
I just know that for threads to work properly it will take a couple of years. Cause it took twitter a long time. And also if you delete the app it deletes your Instagram account;Negative
I just installed and then uninstalled, totally wasted, if you don't have any Instagram account, you can't login in threads, and we all know that Instagram is a su*ks.;Negative
Much better than Twitter, and currently no Elon fan boys;Positive
Good stuff;Positive
Bad app;Negative
Great alternative to apps like Twitter. I actually enjoy it way more.. somehow different;Positive
The greatest ever and more than that bird icon with blue color ü§üüòéü§£;Positive
More than a twitter;Positive
It's glitching every time I open it;Negative
Good app NYC experience;Positive
It takes a lot of time while installing... Reach of the posts is not so good...;Negative
Super op appp;Positive
This app is very lacking I can't even swipe anything;Negative
Bugs;Negative
The application was not working well.when I was it's showing nothing just scratching.not proper working.very bad experience.better to use Instagram...;Negative
It doesn't run ... Get crashed every time I try to use it;Negative
While trying to upload a photo the app is crashing;Negative
Amazing this app;Positive
chat option available in threads app;Positive
It's a wonderful app ‚ù§Ô∏è‚úÖ;Positive
A great app given the fact it's only been a few days since it launched but there are obviously some flaws in it. For example, when I want to post a picture, it often kicks me out of the app and takes hours for it to allow me to post that picture. I also usually can't see who just started following me, shows me my followers fine at first but once I surpass 50-ish followers, I stop receiving notifications and I can no longer see the usernames of those who follow me.;Negative
Too much loading I'm still waiting very bad app;Negative
I downloaded the app it was all fine... I connected it to my insta account but as soon as I started scrolling it got hanged and something weird was happening like the app was having some bug... Plzz fix it..;Negative
Too good liked the AI and UI of the app ü§Ø Instagram connection is a great way to enhance the use of both apps. Great reach with least marketing. Happy threading.;Positive
I wanna like the app, but it keeps crashing every time I try to post a photo;Negative
I like it;Positive
Worst experience as it is not opening even at least for 2 times I have uninstalled it still not working and now I have uninstalled it;Negative
Very nice app, but its missing a few things such as switching accounts, hashtags, taking pictures, etc. Its very smooth and well optimized, unlike instagram for Android which is ironic;Negative
Faul app, not closed to Twitter;Negative
If I don't have / want an Instagram account so I can't login, that's not acceptable. I am uninstalling the app.;Negative
We need an organized feed that doesn't lose position everytime we move from it. Have it at least load a certain number of threads that will be shown next when we drag down to refresh the feed and so on. Such a basic feature;Negative
Worst aap when I'm opening this app it's getting close √∞≈∏¬§¬¶√∞≈∏¬è¬ª‚Äç√¢‚Ñ¢‚Ç¨√Ø¬∏¬è√∞≈∏¬§¬∑√∞≈∏¬è¬ª‚Äç√¢‚Ñ¢‚Ç¨√Ø¬∏¬è√∞≈∏¬§¬∑√∞≈∏¬è¬ª‚Äç√¢‚Ñ¢‚Ç¨√Ø¬∏¬è√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨√∞≈∏¬§¬¨;Negative
lemme explain what scam this is, It will not deactivate even if you deactivate. also, when u want to delete that stupid badge on instagram page, it will appear tone after time after timeeeeee!!!!;Negative
This app could use a free mode, like FB you know;Positive
It's been glitching ever since I've downloaded it;Negative
If I wanted to be on a subpar app where disinfo was not being flagged and allowed to run rampant, I'd just stay on twitter.;Negative
This app is far better than Twitter ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ** Writing this down so that mfs from insta don't join twitter **;Positive
The App crashes again and again, think the developer for to give it the testing team, and push it to live. I'll download the next public release.;Negative
It actually has a lot of bugs! Thread team should fix the bug first before it launched!;Negative
I can't find follow requests sent to me in the ‚ù§ section. It was there but then disappeared? I am very disappointed with it;Negative
Crashes when uploading pics;Negative
I had Awesome Experience using, User Interface is simple, No Fake Accounts, Bots Trolls etc.. like on Twitter hope this app will Replace Twitter and Be A Better Alternative.;Positive
I think it's a really nice app üëçüèΩüòÉ;Positive
Unable to upload 4 pictures;Negative
I wish there is a chat option in threads too, so that we are able to share threads with one another on the same platform instead of copying the link and sharing it on instagram. Also, it would be better if we are able to download the video or the picture directly. I personally feel that maybe threads should be a part of instagram instead of being a complete separate app.. Just like how reels are a part, threads should also be a part of instagram. That would be nice and easier.;Negative
Not bad so far;Positive
So far so good.;Positive
The app was using about 99% of my battery. Deleted it and my battery was working normal.;Negative
Meh, I'm on the fence about it. I know it's new but it has a bunch of things that needs fixing. The timeline, if that's what it's called, needs to show stuff from who I follow, not everyone. I'll check the replies for those comments. Need a dark mode option and ability to make fonts BIGGER and maybe a bold option as well. Also a definite need is when you open the app or refresh the thread, don't go all the way to the top. Keep the thread where I left off, thanks.;Negative
useless, can't even change name or username other than Instagram.;Negative
Great app really but highly addictive (send help);Positive
Requires stupid amount of permissions, can't delete account, and looks awful. It's a very disorganized mess.;Negative
This app is recommendable for fast com.;Positive
AWFUL, TWITTER BETTER;Negative
This app is a privacy nightmare, collects all of your data and worst of all it's owned by Facebook;Negative
It's definitely cool;Positive
Great app;Positive
For an app that just launched a few days ago, it's honestly pretty good!! However, there are a few things I'd like to see improved & made: hashtags, folder to save threads, draft notes.;Positive
Nice competitor of Twitter;Positive
Needs more features;Negative
Twitter was so much better than it.;Negative
Hi dev team I downloaded this app, and I have been trying to login with ig as requested but it always fails saying there's a problem trying to be fixed. What's the problem?;Negative
We can't text in the app;Negative
Collects way too much data;Negative
Ok, first of all, many things are missing in this app. We need a poll option, we need to be properly able to share links, and a lot more gimmicky stuff is missing. Please add them ASAP;Negative
Always keeps crashing when I am trying to upload something;Negative
Very trash app twitter is 1000X better get free speech then we can talk;Negative
So far so good;Positive
Please work on the sounds, there are no sounds for notification on Threads. Also, we can't message privately;Negative
A very good App;Positive
While it's still adding features, sure, it's not MuskTwitter and it's pretty close to the old twitter, so enjoy!;Positive
For a just starting app, it's surprisingly good. Like astonishingly so.;Positive
Such a cozy platform visually, in my opinion. Just cannot scroll through my notifications.... can y'all fix it that?;Negative
Something is wrong with this app, cause it's not working on my phone at all. It's just cloning pages like hundreds and thousands;Negative
Not as good as Twitter it's similar to Instagram;Negative
Ugh, Mr. Zuck collects too much personal data with this app. Let alone all the political bias on his platforms. Stay away!;Negative
As a developer and a normal user, the app is really easy to navigate through and also has a simple ui.;Positive
App is not working properly it is stuck in The middle;Negative
Nothing is interesting in the app. I was expecting something new;Negative
Add a separate feed just for subscriptions and let us choose a general feed by interests or hashtags. i mean, the adds are fine, but not the whole messy feed.;Negative
First of all I like this app. that it's an amazing app.;Positive
But this app is not working properly on my device maybe it's because of my old device. It's glitching, overlapping subrato pages in one page, etc.  ;Negative
Threads is such a fun app but yes it can do with a few improvements, but for myself it's perfect the way it is. It's definitely a goodbye to Twitter from me √∞≈∏Àú¬Å;Positive
i think THIS i's better for Twitter every body yous it this amazing apps;Positive
Does not work!;Negative
I wanna give them a 5star but they've gotta make an option where we can make dm, like everything is literally public √∞≈∏¬•¬∞√∞≈∏¬•¬∞√∞≈∏¬•¬∞ WITH ALL SAID, I'M ALREADY ADDICTED HAHA;Positive
A torrent of meaningless celebrity spam and random posts from people I've never met.;Negative
Needs a lot of work in my opinion. Not getting notifications when those I follow post, all notifications are on, still nothing. Would love it if those I do follow are 1st on my feed. Also, a translate option would be great as I follow non English speaking celebs and have to screenshot posts for translation.;Negative
garbage ui, cant post images due to errors.... more r&d needed if you wanna rip off twitter successfully...;Negative
I keep getting errors when trying to post images.;Negative
Honestly, I haven't had many issues. I do want to see more functionality on this app. ;Positive
Very bad UI.;Negative
My insta keeps crashing ever since i joined threads;Negative
Lots of bug;Negative
I literally just installed this app and it won't even let me open it. It says the app is updating right now to try again later. How is the app updating if I literally just downloaded it?;Negative
Multiple accounts need to be included. Some of us have multiple Instagram accounts.;Negative
You can't delete your account without also deleting your Instagram account. Don't sign up, it's not worth it.;Negative
It's the worst parts of Twitter combined with the worst parts of Facebook;Negative
Needs more features. You can't search posts. You can't use Hashtags. If you have a lot of Instagram followers, then chances are you'll have threads followers. Otherwise, there's no other way to get followers on here. I hope that you develop this app furthermore.;Negative
Nice app √¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è;Positive
i can't even download the app, keep taking my data, downloads still 100 but never installs so terrible;Negative
Better than Twitter already;Positive
Love this app;Positive
Useless pale copy of Twitter without soul and no fun and tremendous use of data. Pointless.;Negative
cheater! Why can't we delete this account without deleting our Instagram, trash company,;Negative
there's a glitch in the app;Negative
Best App;Positive
Fix the algorithm first. I don't want to see those verified accounts on my timeline;Negative
worst social network ever;Negative
This is the most amazing app in the world. I saw it on Facebook today;Positive
Not good, it requires an Instagram account, totally unsafe, your public opinion linked to your cellphone number, your personal information made public.;Negative
I think it is great but some features need to be advanced. First the photo loading time is still slow, secondly I suggest that all Meta Apps could be synced inform of tab/browser where you can switch platforms easily. For example if you are in threads you can have switchable icons or tabs to navigate to Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and vice versa. Fourthly, there should be filters through which people could determine thematic areas of interest including themes, topics, personalities, etc;Negative
A twitter alternative for intolerant leftists who can't cope with conservative opinions and want them censored.;Negative
We need features here.... Thread Groups or Pages Maybe direct messages Hashtags Translations Reactions (like, haha, love, care, angry, wow, etc);Negative
I can't delete my account, they have tricked the users. And I can't even remove the badge from my Instagram account. It's like they are forcing to use this application. Losers, come up with your own ideas, stop stealing and copy pasting stuffs.;Negative
Please don't put the letter's counting this is not good I wanna talk too much and express my feelings freely please solve this and let us be free in what we want to say ..;Negative
Don't have an Instagram account and was no prompt to just make an account for this app. Maybe they'll figure it out later but currently useless app for me;Negative
Great app twitter rival and a good one I used it on the first day of its release liked it. Mr musk is making twitter limited and pay for blue tick is very bad. Money can't buy everything. Hope this app will stay and more and more people come on this and this app should not follow the steps of musk and FB ads factory and keep our data save. Good luck treads.;Positive
A wonderful and new application, but it is similar to Twitter, the only difference is that it is owned by Meta;Positive
wasted many hours downloading this app yesterday. Once I went near Instagram my Threads information was not locatable;Negative
App crashes upon trying to post content just another poorly executed copycat from zuck himself;Negative
If you don't have an Instagram account already, you cannot even login to this app! There is no option to create an account here. Uninstalled.;Negative
Worthless app for now. Created out of spite for another website, you know the one. Will update if it ever gets better.;Negative
Can't post. Whenever I try to make a post the app crashes;Negative
The app is still new and I have installed the app for the first time. The setup was easy to do.;Positive
The app is good;Positive
Trash app. Had to sign up twice and still getting banned or under review after I have written the code on a paper received through my email and phone and also took a selfie. Like damn what else is there for a new user to verify lmao. Meta is a sensitive weakarse company who will never be better than twitter. Update: threads finally let me sign up and verification completed. I hope they don't piss others off but I give them 4 stars. Minus 1 star for pissing me off in the beginning.;Negative
Doesn't refresh √∞≈∏Àú‚Ä¢ stays on the same thing √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö;Negative
Worst app total copy paste;Negative
Very boring a bad and poor copy of Twitter.;Negative
Too much data collection, censorship, and ownership of images. Zuckerberg don't need anymore apps. His companies phony fact checks to control the narrative is unreal and the extreme censorship of speech. I'll stick with twitter thanks.;Negative
Doesn't work with me I wanted to try it but it doesn't work for me I get the idea of competitive marketing, but making it this aggressive and making me have to delete my linked Instagram to threads. U get one star;Negative
The app was okay for the first couple of days and then all my verified accounts and political nonsense. Not even two days and it's turned into Twitter pre-2022.;Negative
Need to be able to only see people I follow in my feed, there's too many accounts I don't care to see.;Negative
The app is nice;Positive
Threads seems to be the reason why my Instagram has stopped working. As for threads itself, I can't see the replies I'm getting. As soon as I have IG back I'm uninstall the whole lot. The functionality is just terrible.;Negative
Wao nice app;Positive
A horrible clone of Twitter abundant with censorship and data collection.;Negative
Too many privacy concerns;Negative
Nice app;Positive
I like it. But it needs improvements: 1. Please add the Options to choose pics from another folder. Its so hard to find it just to scroll down all the way. 2. Add the login option for IG lite user like me. This app is good right now especially I can post longer messages, (of course it's name is thread hehe). Good job Meta √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏¬è¬ª;Negative
You can't use keywords to search for topics, big negative for me but I am looking forward to seeing the development process;Negative
A fair warning: using this app gives Facebook the right to all your data, and you can't delete the account without deleting your Instagram account. Aside from that issue, there is so much basic functionality missing. How did Facebook (Meta) ever greenlight this app?;Negative
My app is not running clearly;Negative
Better than Twitter;Positive
Weird and cool luv it;Positive
I'm loving the App;Positive
Why you can't save pics on the App like Twitter or post any nudes on the App We need these issues fix;Negative
Good apps and easy use;Positive
The app treats people like a product and not a person. Taking your every detail including your personal health information... No wonder it can't show its face in the EU. √∞≈∏¬§¬¶√∞≈∏¬è¬æ;Negative
This app don't work well at all on my phone;Negative
Needs more functionality to compete with other social platforms like direct messaging and searching for anything other than accounts. Currently, the app is down for many people and there is no logic to why it went down. That is surprising and disappointing for such a big corporation already rooted in social media like Meta.;Negative
I want to post a pic but it auto exits.;Negative
I have a problem with the app;Negative
Best app;Positive
Extremely bad app. Has been screen lag from last 3 days and tried many times to fix it by redownloading the app but still doesn't work. Extremely worst experience.;Negative
Why does this app need so many permissions? I permanently deleted Facebook from my phone because somebody told me that I was online, but I did not open the app that day. Why would this app need biometrics and reroute phone calls and reorder running apps and see your health fitness and what other apps you have and activities you're doing and all of that?? Never going to use a meta app again;Negative
I really love this... At least there's another room for opportunity... Twitter ads are cost. And getting engagement could be difficult.... But welcome THREAD....;Positive
App crashes every time I attach a photo.;Negative
Getting crashed for no reason..;Negative
Buggy login experience but now I'm in. Much better platform than Twitter or Reddit at this point.;Positive
BEST APPS I HAVE SEEN EVER.;Positive
You're completely locked in if you sign up. No deleting your account unless you wanna lose your Instagram too. Not to mention your fyp is covered in posts by people you don't even follow;Negative
It's not working;Negative
It cool;Positive
I would learn, like, love from my thread.;Positive
I want to express my appreciation for threads√¢≈ì¬®;Positive
Bad app;Negative
Amazing app loved it would have given it 6 stars if it was possible;Positive
Trash. It's a tracking app. Do not download;Negative
Very good app;Positive
Great app with a lot of potential! ;Positive
However, there is a lot that needs to be fixed. For example, the option to mute accounts is lagging/delayed. This feature is definitely needed at this stage, which is part of the next problem. Another issue I've noticed is the home page shows a lot of accounts I don't follow and have never heard of, and a lot of blue check accounts that I don't want to see. There is no way to filter them out to see the content I actually want, from people I follow.;Negative
Excellent app;Positive
It provides a good experience to build something meaningful.;Positive
Visual bug can't even use to scroll list;Negative
This app seems pretty good so far, but I have noticed that any post notifications have been a day late in being delivered!;Negative
Not useful;Negative
Glitch in the Matrix!;Negative
It's pretty decent;Positive
I'm having problems with my notifications. I get the notifications VERY late, sometimes DAYS later.;Negative
Nice app;Positive
Terrible app. Can't create a new account.;Negative
That is Twitter lite version;Negative
Best APK √∞≈∏¬§≈æ;Positive
Making my personal Instagram account crashed;Negative
Great start. Now keep updating it please.;Positive
"Looks stable on Android so far. Please add an option to disable ""Autoplay"" function for videos.";Positive
Terrible experience. Just use Mastodon directly.;Negative
Trashy basic UI. It looks like they shipped it early just to take advantage of Twitter being down;Negative
One problem is facing no one liking the post;Negative
UI is not coming properly. It's blurry can't read anything. So, please help me to fix it asap;Negative
This app is not enough. I didn't like it. Because if we log in this app we will be stuck. If you log out from this, you will be logged out from Instagram. You should find a solution for this as soon as possible.;Negative
Not happy at all. Do we really need to deactivate our Instagram profile to get rid of the Thread profile? Disappointed.;Negative
Pretty much excellent start but I wish there was a minor option to just view the threads from users I'm following instead of everybody. Also, there is no current way to search for a particular thread.;Negative
"Cannot save pictures & crashes posting pics! Twitter allows you to save any picture; Threads blocks downloads. On Twitter, I can easily post a picture; Threads crashes if I try to post a picture. Ridiculous! So far, this has been a pretty miserable app! I hope they fix it soon.";Negative
Their ii so glitch;Negative
The app invades users' privacy by abusing the public's lack of attention. I would like to delete my Threads account but for that, I need to delete the Instagram account, forcing users to continue using that app. This is completely ridiculous, you could have done better.;Negative
Such an amazing app, nice algorithm;Positive
This app is so amazing and fulfills all the requirements;Positive
My Instagram account was hacked after logging into Threads;Negative
Could use a change of theme;Negative
App is glitch, everything is mashed up together. Unusable;Negative
Its an amazing app;Positive
Not working properly;Negative
I can't upload photos or videos. Every time I write a caption, the application immediately exits suddenly, why?;Negative
Good social app;Positive
It's trash.;Negative
Very nice app √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç;Positive
it is a good option to opt twitter;Positive
Cannot uninstall it deactivate my id when I delete it. Worst privacy;Negative
How user friendly it is√∞≈∏Àú¬ç√∞≈∏‚Äô¬Ø;Positive
Good aap;Positive
Worst APP√∞≈∏Àú‚Äô.;Negative
cant post gifs they come out purple and green and distorted and am not the only one that is happening to fix the app;Negative
THANKS TO SO MUCH I LIKE APPLICATION;Positive
Unable to upload an image.;Negative
Very useful app √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç thanks insta for gifting this type of app√¢‚Ñ¢¬•√Ø¬∏¬è√¢‚Ñ¢¬•√Ø¬∏¬è;Positive
Much better than Twitter;Positive
It is a very good app, it's a better app than Twitter;Positive
there is a small problem, if we delete it when we don't need it, our Instagram account will also be deleted.;Negative
Always very nice;Positive
Problem1 : WHERE IS THE FOLLOWING TAB?? Problem2 : when I type in a text, and it lengthens , the text doesn't scroll up. Instead it gets covered underneath the on screen keyboard I'm typing on making it impossible for me to view the text while I'm typing it. Desired features : those 5 reaction from Facebook next to the standard Heart Like. And the no. Of views on a threads like Twitter has.;Negative
So far, so good. Simple and easy to use!;Positive
This is great I recomend it to everybody;Positive
Cant upload an image says failed to upload thread if i try to add an image;Negative
App has way too many phone permissions. No way to turn off or delete without removing Instagram.;Negative
I can't even use it properly. When I started to scroll or at least go to the other tabs it started to glitch and overlaps everything. Please fix this bug in the next update, I can't have the same experience like what my other friends does.;Negative
There are a lot of glitches.. Whenever I'm trying to touch the screen it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s being overlapped..;Negative
Not useful ,just a copy of another app√∞≈∏‚Äò≈Ω√∞≈∏‚Äò≈Ω;Negative
Nice aap to threads an instagram aap very nice;Positive
Bestest app √∞≈∏‚Äô≈ì;Positive
It is lagging and glitching too much ... I am not able to use it.. So frustrating;Negative
The application don't work properly... The interface is weird the letters are overlapping each other;Negative
Great app;Positive
very good app √∞≈∏‚Äò≈í√∞≈∏¬è¬ª;Positive
I have glitch in this app firstly I enetered all was working but after my second enterance the app hot glitched in which there were 2 oberlays in that solve this problem plz;Negative
The error that is thrown in the UI is super annoying. The exact same thing happens to me every day. I didn't think this error would happen that often. Fix that problem.;Negative
Can't delete threads account without deleting Instagram! Why does it need so many permissions that don't seem at all necessary? It's literally a copy of Twitter but with more censorship, tracking, and creepy personalized ads.;Negative
This app is good.;Positive
Best app of our generation I love it;Positive
It has a lot of bug... I can't even open the application;Negative
It has a lot bug. Not working properly;Negative

This app feels like if Facebook tried to make a Twitter app. It keeps crashing. Had to uninstall, now trying to reinstall;Negative
I enjoy the app and viewing what is on it;Positive
I can't even post on it. Every time I even attempt to post something it glitches out. So I'm just bummed about that :/;Negative
Crashes every time I try posting a simple photo. Happens with both Samsung Galaxy S21 and S23. Would love to see a way to toggle between random posts and those from only people I follow.;Negative
Starting was good like login and editing the bio.;Positive

If you login this app 5 later your account got hacked Instagram;Negative
Mine keeps crashing when I @, quote or add a photo, tried uninstalling reinstall restart phone..... Nothing on Google to say what the issue is. Phone works fine with all other Meta apps;Negative

the scrolling animation is too much laggy and it feels too much annoying...;Negative
Threads crashes everytime when I post photos. I use Android.;Negative

Why when I use it , it's glitching . I did screenshot it...;Negative
I having trouble about logging in using my Instagram account.;Negative
Despite the fact that the app is still developing, I don't see the reason why it keeps scrambling up when I try scrolling through the threads...;Negative

App is not stable;Negative
Best app;Positive
Apps very good;Positive
Marvellous;Positive
It's a new app, and I believe it still needs improvement. While typing, the keyboard covers the text, which makes it hard to see what someone is typing. Also, I think it make a lot of sense of I can see people that follows me on their profile.;Negative
Better than Twitter;Positive
All Good;Positive
Refresh & Scroll Rate is To Much Slow Please Work On It...;Negative
Very nice app, i am impressed with it very much and it's software optimisation.;Positive

I love this √∞≈∏Àú¬ª so I want to try because someone tell me this is a good app√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è;Positive
Best app √∞≈∏‚Äì¬§;Positive
Just copy the Twitter concept with low UI and features quality as social media app.;Negative
So many bugs while writing keep showing my keyboards not keys, Fix that issue;Negative
Vary nice app;Positive
Not so good , even now I can't delete this thread account from threads;Negative
"Not only are serious security shortcomings prevalent, but placing ""Post"" & other interactive buttons at the bottom of the page means they are obscured by QWERTY & Google keypads on most smartphones. By comparison Twitter has all functions top of page.";Negative
The application keeps glitching since I open it, once I touch the screen it glitches, can't use it at all;Negative
Pretty darn solid option on the social media landscape;Positive
This app is not working;Negative
Can't comment post on Android, the keyboard hides the text input;Negative
Twitter's dumb clone;Negative

So clean! I love how minimal the monochromic color palette that was used.;Positive
Better than the Twitter app as I'm totally loving it!! √¢¬ù¬§;Positive
Very good using this app;Positive
It is a meaningless app;Negative
It's a good platform for socializing as like Twitter;Positive
Today after 6 to 7 hours of installing the app got closed till now it is showing try again. I uninstalled.;Negative
It keeps bugging;Negative
Very basic and poorly interface;Negative
What's the point of following people if their posts never actually show up on your home tab? Instead all I see is random people posting about how much they like Threads, so it really just looks like the app is trying to make itself look good without actually doing anything useful.;Negative
Please do something. The app is not working. This app is horrible √∞≈∏Àú‚Äù;Negative
Thank you Meta nice √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç app I like;Positive
Rubbish App √∞≈∏Àú¬°√∞≈∏Àú¬°√∞≈∏Àú¬° Twitter is best √¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è;Negative
The app is smooth;Positive
"There's a lot to be desired for on this app. I would like to see a ""This person follows you"" badge on someone's profile who follows me. A feed option of only accounts that I do follow. And most of all, being about to choose specific folders from my gallery to post pictures and videos from. uploading photos sometimes crashes it. Otherwise, I can see this being a potential killer for Twitter.";Negative
I hate this app √∞≈∏Àú¬Æ√¢‚Ç¨¬ç√∞≈∏‚Äô¬®√∞≈∏Àú¬Æ√¢‚Ç¨¬ç√∞≈∏‚Äô¬®;Negative
Privacy is guaranteed in the app;Positive

Just made an account and the screen glitches out immediately. Texts overlapping each other, it's a mess. Will get fixed though i believe, but will uninstall it. Wanna send a screenshot, but here is no option. F.;Negative

The app is good but instgram shall provide an option to delete the threads profile without deleting the instgram account.;Negative
Too much boring.. ;Negative
My application is crashing;Negative
AMAZING APP;Positive
It has been synchronized with the Instagram ID, which is very struggling process. I don't know those who don't have insta id, how they sign in to the app...?;Negative
It very helpful to me.√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√∞≈∏‚Ñ¢‚Äö;Positive
Arabic Should be Right Justified. Threads text, in languages other than English, should allow right-justify for people who write right to left. Otherwise, the default left-justified text looks unnatural to it's readers.;Negative
i don't know why is it getting glitch!!! the page does not get loaded and so many pages at a time get opened!!!;Negative
Awesome!!!;Positive
App isnt working properly. It keeps showing glitches after entering dashboard.;Negative
Unusable. The app full of glitches, it's impossible to read even one post. Only posted photos are visible.;Negative
Love the app way better then twitter;Positive
The Best App;Positive

Unaccepted error;Negative
Worth App;Positive
This app is great so far for me it's better than stupid twitter the ui is nice there's little to no bots you don't get any of the dumb people so far and they actually take moderation so far a little better than twitter actually allowing things instead of saying existing broke guidelines garbage;Positive
While the app is a good one;Positive
I can't post media on it,anytime I try to post pictures and videos,the app just closes... It's frustrating!!;Negative
Great alternative to the musky blue bird.;Positive

But I'm having issues mentioning @ or trying to post a write up all of a sudden it just goes off like it just disappear √∞≈∏Àú‚Äù√∞≈∏Àú¬≠;Negative
Just download and open it. No big sign up headache. When you follow people you have to click the bell on the top right of the screen for their profile so you get their newsfeed. All in all so much better than twatter;Negative

This app is totally useless Twitter is totally better than this app;Negative
Couldn't even explore the app because of this glitches. Even for a small touch it starts glitching. Couldn't rate more unless the bug is fixed.;Negative
Bad experience I think. It's been 5 days of use of thread √∞≈∏¬ß¬µ. I have got alot of problems using thread because we can't save photos here we cant enter and give a long space here that makes a problem. Along with that there are alot of problem this app can probably replace twitter in future √∞≈∏Àú‚Äù yea I am also sad a out that but watching it's exponential growth over days I can easily predict it's potential in market. I hope thread can solve challenge user facing and makes a good user experience √¢≈ì¬®;Negative

Good;Positive
Except for the smoothness of the UI, ;Positive
what is wrong with having to press the speaker button if u want to upload a video huh?? the button is so tiny and most of the times users forgot to press that button... it's so stupid. Also, what is the purpose of following someone if we're gonna see random people's postings in our tl anyway?? Do not see where you are going with this honestly. the UX is noticably worse than its' competitors.;Negative
Great;Positive
I love that clean and convenient User interface. Keep it up.;Positive
This is nice social media app;Positive
Lack of features;Negative

Not a single person I follow shows up on my timeline, just 3rd rate influencers. no option to see only those I follow? also when replying, I can't see my own prompt, the keyboard covers it...;Negative
Gathers a ton of unnecessary data + can't delete account without deleting your insta account.;Negative
I think this app is great;Positive

For a while I give one star, because this application does not have a system to restore hidden thread badges on the Instagram profile. If there was, I would give 5 stars.;Negative
Better than Twitter.;Positive
Very good app;Positive
The algorithm is horrible & and it's a horrendous copy of Twitter;Negative
I am try login to this app but all time error show. I am unable to login in any way for these three days. Please solve this issue.;Negative
Pros: -My system font works on this app, while it doesn't work on other similar apps.;Positive
Overall, the app is good. Its performance is great for it being initial release. ;Positive
Toxic algorithm. I prefer twitter;Negative
Worst app ever;Negative

It's got potential, but it's bland and boring so far without many features , and locking people in via Instagram isn't cool.;Negative
Not bad but still this app is connected with Instagram and I don't like this feature;Negative
Good experience √∞≈∏‚Äò‚Ç¨√¢≈ì¬®;Positive
That's good app;Positive
Literally it gives a great experience It is more better than any social media app;Positive
Potentially brilliant, but at the moment there are just wwaayy too many posts from accounts I do not follow filling up my feed. Not sure it's chronologically presented either which is a massive killer for me.;Negative

Worst experience. Trying to upload the post since yesterday, 'Thread failed to upload' message pops up every time. Really frustrating. Did all the thing like , cleared cache, OS update n all. Still pathetic experience. These kind of things wasn't expected from a Meta product.;Negative

Well designed, easy to use;Positive
You can't see the text input window when replying. It is covered by the keyboard making it so you can't see what you are typing.;Negative
Very nice app;Positive
First time open bugs √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö√∞≈∏¬§¬£;Negative
Search function only searches accounts, not posts or keywords. Useless. The timeline is all influencers, sports, and celebrity accounts w/ high traffic. I barely see the posts from accounts I'm following! After muting unwanted accounts my timeline has not changed in the last 12 hours and I can only continuously scroll thru the same handful of posts from yesterday. No option to view posts I've liked or bookmark things to revisit later. I know it's early days but these are critical features.;Negative
It's bugging a lot when I install it and gets irritated. When I try to scroll, remarks of the previous page are left behind and can't read other things. Please fix it.;Negative
Ever best satisfied application it is, besides extra facilities remain here√∞≈∏Àú≈†;Positive
My threads are having a bug or technical problem.;Negative
The potential for a good app is there, but it's not good yet. Most notably, the front page is filled almost exclusively with people you don't follow. App is literally unusable until a following-only feed is implemented.;Negative
Well, I have 3 accounts on insta. My name as the first and another two as sub-accounts. Soon I create an account on threads, it gives one of the two sub-accounts as a profile, I can't find any possibility to change my account name or picture. Thank you in advance. Regards,;Negative

Super app like;Positive
Amazing;Positive
It is easy to use, and it isn't a hell scape like Twitter.;Positive
Mine is not loading(opening) again after I used it on the first and second day, what could be the reason?;Negative
"Terrible experience, the whole algorithm timeline is the absolute worst, I am inundated with thousands of UTTERLY MALIGNANT USELESS ASININE content from ""creators"" that I could not care less if they imploded, I spend more time muting accounts than I do posting anything, I don't care about this new feed I'm being fed, I can't search for content I actually care about, this app as it is, is absolutely irrelevant, that being said the interface is straightforward and posting is easygoing.

Awesome √∞≈∏Àú≈Ω;Positive
Very amazing and wonderful √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç;Positive
I signed up with Instagram and then installed threads. In Threads, I muted several posters. I did not post in either app. but, a warning popped up that I had violated Community standards. currently apparently disagreeing with the algorithm is a violation of community. if I wanted complete lack of control I would go back to Twitter.;Negative
Better than Twitter;Positive
Boring;Negative
This is very awesome √¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è love it;Positive
The app is a very big crash, full of bugs, but it's good to see Instagram is trying something new fantastic keep it up;Negative
Lovely √∞≈∏‚ÄòÀÜ√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√∞≈∏‚Äò≈íapp;Positive
This app was not installing;Negative
Crashes too often;Negative
Crashed at least 30 times, every time I try to upload a picture it stops.;Negative
Big like;Positive
I can't unfollow it keeps telling sorry pls try again later ... Please work on this issue;Negative
Put the first post on with a few pictures all great. ;Positive

Very good threads aap;Positive
Very good application;Positive
Nice app. Is it so cute then Twitter??????;Positive
I want to like it. But it only lets me post pics for one day before going back to crashing every time I try....;Negative
Best;Positive
Nice app;Positive
I'm loving the app, the only fix I want apart from bug fixes is some control/filter over what we see on our feed. I don't even see the threads by people I follow, and don't wanna see random lame meme pages.;Negative
Buggy;Negative
I can't post a picture, why??;Negative
Nice app for usage;Positive
I love this app √¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è√¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è (√¢¬Å¬†√£∆í¬ª√¢¬Å¬†√¢ÀÜ‚Ç¨√¢¬Å¬†√£∆í¬ª√¢¬Å¬†);Positive
Wow nice app√∞≈∏‚Äù¬•;Positive
It is a good app and overall good concept but I guess it is better if u add chat option and stories with the new updates. This is just the beginning. I hope we will see good later;Positive
Great app√∞≈∏¬•¬∞;Positive
Overlapping and is threads working in the Android version;Negative
Amazing;Positive
Downloaded after not working Instagram properly, anyone facing the same problem?;Negative
Great to use;Positive
Perfect;Positive
Nice √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç beautiful;Positive
Algorithm for the feed needs a lot of work. I'm seeing the same threads day after day at the top of my feed even if I've seen them half a dozen times already. A lot of random junk I don't care about.;Negative
My Instagram video not playing when I installed √∞≈∏Àú¬°√∞≈∏Àú¬°;Negative
Hot garbage;Negative
Very dead application not working properly.√¢Àú¬π√Ø¬∏¬è√¢Àú¬π√Ø¬∏¬è√∞≈∏Àú √∞≈∏Àú¬†√∞≈∏Àú¬°;Negative
Not working on Redmi note 6 pro. Overlapping text issues on scroll.;Negative
Literally insane! A good competitor to √∞≈∏¬ê¬¶ :);Positive
though it would be nice to be able to choose the photos from their folder instead of scrolling all the way down just to post it in the app;Positive
So far so good, the app is easy to use;Positive
I say only, it's a very nice app Thanks META;Positive
While uploading photos, it keeps getting kicked out of the app, shows that the photos are not coming in the form of files or positions, all of them come together, so many problems are faced.;Negative
Wow good app√¢‚Ñ¢¬•√Ø¬∏¬è;Positive
Wayy better community and content than its competitor (Twitter);Positive
Easy to handle, easy to use;Positive
Didn't even load on my Android device.;Negative
Better than Twitter.;Positive
It's clearly rolled out in haste, but I appreciate the people who worked on this app. There is no method to add more than one profile which we can toggle between on Instagram. So if we have 2 profiles on Instagram, u can only use one. Hope this will be resolved soon.;Negative
Best platform;Positive
Super app;Positive
This is not a high-quality app. In this, the post of useless people comes to your home without calling you, picture editing facility is also not available in this.;Negative
Worst app;Negative
Fix the bugs it's been days and I am not being able to use it;Negative
Not optimized for phones with smaller screens.;Negative
Best app;Positive
1 star because my feed is full of suggested rubbish that I don't want to see just like Facebook and Instagram. I should only see posts from people I follow. I'm sick of Meta throwing complete nonsense onto our newsfeeds;Negative
My tread having bug/glitch this is why my thread doesn't work anyway so please check it out and repair it! My Instagram I'd :- abuu.talibb;Negative
Features requests & bugs (so far): - notification scrolling is very limited - only full gallery is available when looking for a file to attach - no ability to just switch accounts (you have to log out every time) - no dark mode (please for the love of my retinas!);Negative
Wow lovely √∞≈∏≈í¬π;Positive
Very bad;Negative
Booooring!!!;Negative
Why I am having a bug?;Negative
works very smoothly √¢Àú¬∫√Ø¬∏¬è√∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç well-done!;Positive
Excellent app;Positive
The app scrolls slowly and does not work properly in dark mode;Negative
Unusable mess, literally cannot read/see anything because of a bug;Negative
Better app from Twitter √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö√∞≈∏Àú‚Äö;Positive
Easy to Use and better than Twitter I love this app;Positive
Glitched, and choppy;Negative
Threads crashed on my phone;Negative
Worst app;Negative
Very nice √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏‚Ñ¢‚Äö;Positive
Worst app, √∞≈∏Àú¬≠ fully glitched screen.;Negative
It's too bad. It's not working. I don't want to rate it at all;Negative
When I upload images, the app crashes;Negative
Awesome, helpful app. Better than Twitter;Positive
"here no option to ""PHOTOS""√∞≈∏‚Äì¬º√Ø¬∏¬è save in the gallery.";Negative
This app is good ;Negative
Most informative app;Positive
This is very safe, careful, and video reel & photo amazing in view app is very nice is the future and technology very nice;Positive
Too good √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏¬è¬ª√∞≈∏Àú≈†;Positive
Why do I see so many irrelevant threads? The feed is a huge mess;Negative
Very good app bro like Twitter dad √∞≈∏¬•¬µ√∞≈∏¬•¬µ√∞≈∏¬•¬µ√¢≈ì‚Ä¶√¢≈ì‚Ä¶√¢≈ì‚Ä¶;Positive
Not impressed;Negative
The app pops up and bugs again√∞≈∏Àú‚Äòplease fix it!;Negative
Perfect!;Positive
Absolutely a very good app coz many of their accounts got hacked so it can help easily to find hackers;Positive
Very bad experience √∞≈∏Àú‚Äù;Negative
What the hell man, I can't use threads whenever I scroll it It just skits all the time. I can't even read it, what's written can't even see what a waste;Negative
Enjoying Threads;Positive
So far, it is very nice;Positive
Buggy app the display is shattering;Negative
Great √∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç;Positive
Love it;Positive
Awesome √∞≈∏Àú¬ç;Positive
The application will not let me create an account, And the easy log in through Google does not work.;Negative
There is a screen glitch in my threads account. Try to solve the glitch (Device:- Redmi note 6 );Negative
Bug fix √∞≈∏Àú‚Äú;Negative
App constantly crashing when trying to comment on threads, also whenever tagging an account it just crashes straight away. Huawei P20 Pro.;Negative
Wow Excellent;Positive
Very nice apps;Positive
It's just like Twitter I guess but the glitchiness is making it almost completely unusable. If I could upload a photo of what it looks like I would. It's headache-inducing.;Negative
Won't let you log in without an Instagram account.;Negative
I love this app;Positive
I just tried to upload a picture captured from the camera, but this app keeps crashing.;Negative
Love it;Positive
Very poor app;Negative
Nice features and easy to use.;Positive
Good app;Positive
Better Than Twitter;Positive
Nice app overall;Positive
Not working at all... app is crashing a lot can't see any posts;Negative
This app not downloaded;Negative
Well I installed the app out of curiosity and it seems interesting but whenever I open the app, it's all glitch. I'm unable to see a single word perfectly and everything is just messed up on the screen. Hope you resolve such bugs and issues soon and be able to provide a great user experience.;Negative
Excellent app;Positive
Real buggy. I can't even upload a photo without it crushing. Back to Twitter it is.;Negative
I can't attach a photo. Once I selected from Gallery then press ok. The app keeps on crashing and just went down. Again and Again, same situation. Please fix this frustrating issue.;Negative
It's good but needs more feature updates;Positive
I can't post anything on threads. It just closes up. Fix it please;Negative
Sometimes I can post pictures and sometimes it crashes the app. It'll be better when the bugs get worked out for a new app.;Negative
Worst experience, my Instagram account logs out automatically as soon as I login to threads;Negative
appens to glitch every time I enter the app√∞≈∏‚Äô‚Ç¨;Negative
It's glitching every time I open the app. I hope it's fixed soon!;Negative
Easy and smooth like cream;Positive
The app is cool. But I couldn't access my photo folders. It's a newly launched app, so there's still room for improvement.;Negative
It is not working well... it hangs...;Negative
"Overall a good experience so far; however, could be improved. I have only used it for a day but the inability to properly search by topics makes me feel like I see posts that are irrelevant to me than the posts which I can relate to. It would be helpful to have hashtags available but I understand that at the moment, the app is a new launch and still has a lot of development to go through. Hopefully, we'll be able to give five stars in the future.";Negative
"Worst app. Twitter is better than threads and Twitter is better optimized; it runs smoothly on my device, and on the other hand, threads are lagging a little bit on my device. Copy-paste is not the best solution, and if you try to uninstall it, your Instagram account will deactivate. I can't even DM my crush.";Negative
Uploading photos is always a problem;Negative
Not at all working, lots of bugs, error while using;Negative
It's okay but I don't like how pictures appear... not full size of monitor width;Positive
Constant app bug;Negative
I love the clean interface and the lack of pointless config.;Positive
However, why is my feed filled with people I don't follow??? I've tried the suggested workarounds and they don't work;Negative
I love the idea but recently I've been unable to access my followers list. Keep saying I should try again. It's really hindering the smooth flow I was enjoying for the first few days.;Negative
The app is great, but it keeps stopping every time I attach a picture to the thread.;Negative
My home screen is just a pile of posts from accounts that I don't follow, never heard of, and don't want to see. I'm completely uninterested in all these posts. And there's no way to only see the accounts you follow--you're forced to see all the junk. Why would anyone intentionally want junk mail?;Negative
This app is terrible. Nothing works correctly, even on an S23 Ultra. Very useless. Not enjoyable whatsoever;Negative
"This app is annoying! I try to delete my account; you can't. I try to remove that number from my bio you can't. This is wrong. I should be able to add and delete apps if I wanted to!!!";Negative
Once I open the app, it starts glitching. I have installed and uninstalled 3 times now. I can't even scroll the timeline or go to profile.;Negative
Lag;Negative
It's not that bad but there's a little problem in it. I want to edit my bio and import it from Instagram but it keeps saying there's something went wrong. I need help if you read this.;Negative
There is no option to edit typo mistakes. I can't see where to add a video. In fact, I can't see where to add or post anything! Managed it once but don't know how? My icons seem to be missing! Using tablet and tried phone! Doesn't flow for me! I'll wait until it works properly before I invest too much time with it!;Negative
Cannot even log in, just keeps coming up with error, u installed.;Negative
Same poor data collection practices as other Meta apps. Battery drains much faster with this app in the background, potentially due to a larger data collection pool than other apps. Lacks lots of engaging features and currently prioritizes posts from creators established on Instagram rather than followed accounts;Negative
The app works smoothly and is well-designed.;Positive
App-breaking screen bug where it looks like multiple different screens are all overlaying over each other and you can't see anything. Scroll and it gets 100x worse;Negative
Extremely buggy. I can't even scroll without every screen overlapping on top of each other and creating a mess.;Negative
Liked it until today when it started crashing. Right now, it won't open at all.;Negative
Stagnant Glitches when I scroll the page up and down;Negative
